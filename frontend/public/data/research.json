    "relationships": "Monotonic strength of 17,000 and 35,000 Gy groups were less than the prescribed cyclic loading force. Fatigue life, strain to failure, and elastic stiffness for the 50 and 1,000 Gy exposures did not differ from the control.",

    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3040128/",
    "objective": "To determine whether additional pathways are altered with the loss of γ-sarcoglycan, extending previous studies on mechanosensitive, γ-sarcoglycan-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation.",
    "methodology": "Mechanotransduction was examined in the presence and absence of γ-sarcoglycan, using C2C12 myotubes, primary cultures, and isolated muscles from C57Bl/6 and γ-sarcoglycan-null mice. All were subjected to cyclic passive stretch. Signaling protein phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting of lysates from stretched and non-stretched samples. Calcium dependence was assessed by maintaining muscles in calcium-free or tetracaine-supplemented Ringer’s solution. Dependence on mTOR was determined by stretching isolated muscles in the presence or absence of rapamycin.",
    "results": "C2C12 myotube stretch caused an increase in P-p70S6K, but decreased P-FAK and P-ERK2. Neither Akt nor ERK1 were responsive to passive stretch. Similar but non-significant trends were observed in C57 primary cultures in response to stretch, and γ-SG-/- cultures displayed no p70S6K response. In contrast, in isolated muscles, p70S6K was mechanically responsive. Basal p70S6K activation was elevated in muscles of γ-SG-/- mice, in a calcium-independent manner. p70S6K activation increased with stretch in both C57 and γ-SG-/- isolated muscles, and was sustained in γ-SG-/- muscles, unlike the transient response in C57 muscles. Rapamycin treatment blocked p70S6K activation in stretched C57 muscles, and reduced downstream S6RP phosphorylation. However, even though rapamycin treatment decreased p70S6K activation in stretched γ-SG-/- muscles, S6RP phosphorylation remained elevated.",
    "conclusions": "p70S6K is an important component of γ-sarcoglycan-dependent mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle. Loss of γ-sarcoglycan uncouples the response of p70S6K to stretch, implying that γ-sarcoglycan is important for inactivation of this pathway. Altered load-sensing mechanisms exist in muscular dystrophies where the sarcoglycans are absent.",
    "relationships": "The study suggests a relationship between γ-sarcoglycan, p70S6K, and mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle. It also indicates a connection between the loss of γ-sarcoglycan and altered load-sensing mechanisms in muscular dystrophies.",
    "insights": "The findings increase the understanding of the contribution of aberrant load-sensing to the pathology of muscular dystrophies where the SG complex is deficient. γ-SG may be required for dephosphorylation and deactivation of p70S6K. The study identifies p70S6K as part of a novel SG-dependent mechanosensitive signaling pathway in skeletal muscle.",

Uninfected space flies showed an altered transcriptional profile with upregulation of stress response genes.",
    "conclusions": "Hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects on immune responses in Drosophila. Spaceflight produces stress-related transcriptional responses and results in a specific inability to mount a Toll-mediated infection response.

    "objective": "To investigate the effects of spaceflight and simulated microgravity on the virulence of Serratia marcescens and the immune response of Drosophila melanogaster.",
    "methodology": "Serratia marcescens was exposed to spaceflight conditions on the International Space Station (ISS) and simulated microgravity conditions on Earth using a rotating wall vessel (RWV). Drosophila melanogaster were infected with these bacteria, and their survival rates and in vivo bacterial growth were monitored. RNA sequencing was performed to analyze gene expression changes in the infected flies.",
    "results": "Spaceflight-exposed Serratia marcescens exhibited increased virulence in Drosophila melanogaster compared to ground controls. This increased virulence was also observed in bacteria grown in simulated microgravity. The increased virulence phenotype was temporary and reversible upon return to Earth conditions. The Imd and Toll immune pathways in the flies did not significantly alter the increased lethality caused by space-flown bacteria. RNA sequencing revealed few significant changes in host gene expression related to immunity.",
    "conclusions": "Spaceflight and simulated microgravity can induce temporary changes in Serratia marcescens, leading to increased virulence in Drosophila melanogaster. These changes are likely due to alterations in the pathogen itself, rather than a significant difference in the host's immune response. Microgravity may be a primary factor mediating the differences in virulence seen in the spaceflight bacteria strains.",
    "relationships": "The study highlights the relationship between spaceflight conditions, bacterial virulence, and host immune response. It demonstrates that microgravity can alter bacterial physiology, leading to increased pathogenicity. The study also suggests that the host immune system may not be the primary driver of increased lethality observed in spaceflight-exposed bacteria.",
    "insights": "The findings suggest that spaceflight can induce physiological changes in bacteria, potentially posing a threat to immunocompromised astronauts. Further research is needed to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms driving these changes and to develop strategies to mitigate the risks associated with spaceflight-induced bacterial virulence.",

    "results": "The periplasmic region of the channel, particularly a residue at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface (I49 in E. coli, F47 in S. aureus), plays a major role in both the open dwell time and threshold of activation (mechanosensitivity). Specific mutations at this site altered channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity, correlating with the hydrophobicity of the substitutions.",
    "conclusions": "A single amino acid at the periplasmic end of TM1 acts as a 'clasp knife spring,' influencing the resistance and stability of channel opening and closing. The hydrophobicity and steric shape of this residue, along with the periplasmic loop, define channel mechanosensitivity and kinetics.",

Biomechanical properties were evaluated using three-point bending. Histomorphometry was performed on tibial sections.",
    "results": "The PWS system successfully maintained mice in partial weight-bearing conditions with minimal stress.

    "methodology": "The study used the eutardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis as a model organism. ROS production was analyzed in coelomocytes using a fluorescent probe. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to disrupt the function of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase), aquaporins (aquaporins 3 and 10), and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase. Motility of tardigrades was evaluated after desiccation and rehydration.",
    "results": "Desiccation induces a significant increase in ROS production in tardigrade storage cells. Targeting the glutathione peroxidase gene compromised survival during drying and rehydration. Targeting genes encoding glutathione reductase and catalase indicated that these molecules play roles during rehydration. Aquaporins 3 and 10 are involved during rehydration. Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase targeting did not significantly affect animal motility.",
    "conclusions": "Anhydrobiosis causes a significant increase in ROS production, leading to oxidative stress in tardigrades. Desiccation tolerance depends on the synergistic action of different molecules. Glutathione peroxidase plays a crucial role in desiccation tolerance. Aquaporins are involved in rehydration. Trehalose is not the only molecule involved in desiccation tolerance.",
    "relationships": "The study highlights the relationship between oxidative stress, antioxidant defenses, and desiccation tolerance in tardigrades. It also shows the interplay between different bioprotectants in ensuring survival during anhydrobiosis.",
    "insights": "The findings suggest that tardigrades employ a complex strategy involving multiple molecules to combat the stresses of desiccation. The study provides insights into the specific roles of antioxidant enzymes and aquaporins in the anhydrobiotic process.",

    "objective": "To explore musculoskeletal adaptation along the continuum of loading between disuse and normal weight bearing using the partial weight suspension (PWS) model. The primary question was whether variable PWB differentially influences muscle atrophy and bone loss, hypothesizing a linear relationship between weight bearing and bone/muscle loss.",
    "methodology": "Skeletally mature female mice were subjected to partial weight bearing (PWB) at 20%, 40%, or 70% of body weight, or hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 21 days. Control groups included fully loaded mice with and without a harness. Bone and muscle adaptation were assessed using DXA, μCT, mechanical testing, and muscle mass measurements. Gait kinematics were measured at different weight-bearing levels. Fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM) were measured to assess adrenocortical activity.",
    "results": "Bone and muscle changes were generally proportional to the degree of unloading in PWB groups. Total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, trabecular bone volume of the distal femur, and cortical area of the femur midshaft were linearly related to the degree of unloading. Even a load reduction to 70% of normal weight bearing was associated with significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy. HLU resulted in greater muscle atrophy than PWB at 20%, but similar or slightly better bone outcomes.",
    "conclusions": "The PWS model is effective in applying controllable, reduced, long-term loading that produces predictable adaptive changes in muscle and bone. Bone and muscle loss are linearly related to the degree of unloading. Even a load reduction to 70% of normal weight bearing is associated with significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy. Hindlimb unloading is not equivalent to 0% PWB, and the PWB and HLU models are functionally different.",
    "relationships": "A strong correlation (r = 0.75) was found between gastrocnemius mass and percent change in hindlimb BMD across all groups. Within the PWB groups, muscle and bone outcomes showed a strong dependence on the degree of PWB, with most variables decreasing monotonically with decreasing weight bearing.",
    "insights": "The study suggests that the physiological window of normal strain stimulus (lazy zone) for bone adaptation may be narrower than previously proposed. Extended minor reductions in physical activity may cause proportionate degrees of bone loss. The PWS model offers advantages in preserving normal gait kinematics and strain distribution, making it a valuable tool for studying regional differences in bone's sensitivity to mechanical signals.",

Mice were assigned to four groups: CON-VEH, CON-mBMPR1A-mFc, HLU-VEH, and HLU-mBMPR1A-mFc. mBMPR1A-mFc was administered subcutaneously twice per week. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (pDXA). Bone microarchitecture was assessed using microcomputed tomography (mCT). Bone strength was evaluated using three-point bending tests. Histomorphometry was performed to assess bone formation and resorption.",
    "results": "HLU led to a decline in leg BMD, whereas mBMPR1A-mFc treatment prevented this decline. mBMPR1A-mFc treatment led to greater trabecular bone volume, trabecular thickness, and cortical thickness in both HLU and CON groups.

    "conclusions": "Treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein may be useful for maintenance of skeletal integrity in the setting of disuse-induced bone loss by increasing bone formation and reducing bone resorption.",
    "relationships": "mBMPR1A-mFc binds to BMP2 and BMP4, preventing downstream signaling. It inhibits dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) expression in osteoblasts to activate canonical Wnt signaling to promote bone formation. It also reduces receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) expression in osteoblasts, resulting in decreased bone resorption.",
    "insights": "Inhibiting BMP2/4 signaling via treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein led to increased bone mass and improved bone microarchitecture by increased bone formation rate and decreased osteoclast surface.

Post-flight snails were compared to four control groups: a naive group, a starvation group, a dark control group, and a gravity overloading group. Behavioral studies (gravitaxis, tentacle withdrawal), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of statocysts, transcriptome analysis of statocysts (RNA sequencing), and electrophysiological studies of the statocyst reflex arc were conducted.",
    "results": "Post-flight snails exhibited a shorter duration of the T0 phase of gravitaxis, and retracted their tentacles to a lesser degree compared to control groups.

Electrophysiological studies showed an increased statocyst response to vestibular stimulation in post-flight snails. The statocyst response of early post-flight snails was significantly larger than that of late post-flight and overload snails.",
    "conclusions": "The vestibular system of land snails undergoes adaptive changes in response to spaceflight, including alterations in behavior, gene expression, and neural activity. The increased sensitivity of statoreceptors after spaceflight is likely due to neural plasticity within the statocyst itself or in central circuits. Readaptation to normal gravity occurs within approximately 20 hours after landing.",

    "objective": "To discuss how the ER–Golgi interface and COPII-mediated trafficking varies in different species, focusing on plant and mammalian systems as examples of adaptation to meet differentiated eukaryotic cell needs. The ultimate goal is to understand the regulatory mechanisms that control protein and lipid trafficking in the early secretory pathway.",
    "methodology": "The review compares the ER–Golgi interface across different systems, particularly mammalian and plant cells, highlighting fundamental elements and distinct organization. It examines models for COPII carrier-mediated trafficking from the ER in mammalian cells (separated ER and Golgi with an intermediate compartment) versus plant cells (closely associated ER and Golgi with high mobility).",
    "results": "The organization of the ER–Golgi interface varies greatly across species. Plants and some yeast have a compact ER and Golgi organization, while animal cells have a pleomorphic intermediate compartment. The distribution of COPII budding sites, transport vesicles, and dependence on cytoskeletal components also vary. The ER–Golgi interface can adapt to accommodate variations in COPII carrier size and number based on cargo dimensions and quantity.",
    "conclusions": "A conserved core machinery transports biosynthetic cargo forward in the early secretory pathway, balanced with retrieval routes that maintain the ER and Golgi compartments. Diversity in eukaryotic cell types and functions generates variety in the organization of the ER–Golgi interface. Each trafficking step provides multiple opportunities for regulation that could influence vesicle and organelle size and shape. The influence of cargo and cellular architecture are key drivers of interface organization.",
    "relationships": "COPI and COPII are required for bidirectional membrane trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi. COPII operates in the anterograde pathway from the ER, and COPI functions in the retrograde route from the Golgi. The integrity of the anterograde traffic route depends tightly on the homeostasis of the retrograde pathway.",
    "insights": "The ER–Golgi interface is a dynamic and adaptable system, with variations in organization reflecting cellular specialization and the types of cargo being transported. Understanding the molecular basis for observed membrane structures and dynamics is tightly coupled with function. Future studies should integrate cellular regulatory networks with the core machinery to understand how the ER–Golgi interface is maintained under changing conditions.",

    "objective": "To understand how plants respond to spaceflight stress by examining the significance of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in Arabidopsis thaliana during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space Station (ISS).",
    "methodology": "Comparative transcriptome profiling was performed on wild-type Arabidopsis and UPR-defective mutants during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission. Plants were cultivated in orbit and on Earth under controlled conditions. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to analyze gene expression changes. Statistical analyses and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment were performed to identify biological pathways.",
    "results": "Orbital culture significantly altered the expression of stress-related genes compared to ground control. While gene expression varied in UPR mutants on the ground, it was largely similar across genotypes in spaceflight. Spaceflight resulted in an increase of total RNA. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, with WT having the largest number. Upregulated DEGs were more numerous than downregulated DEGs. K-means clustering analysis revealed variations in DEGs between genotypes were primarily due to variable expression in ground control samples.",
    "conclusions": "Spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks. The UPR plays a partial role in regulating transcriptional reprogramming in space compared to ground control. bZIP60 has functions independent of IRE1 and bZIP28. The UPR does not have a broad involvement in the response to spaceflight.",
    "relationships": "The study explores the relationship between the unfolded protein response (UPR) and plant adaptation to spaceflight. It examines the roles of IRE1, bZIP28, and bZIP60 in regulating gene expression under microgravity-associated conditions.",
    "insights": "Spaceflight-induced transcriptional responses mitigate the need for gene-regulatory networks controlled by UPR sensors. Media contact could induce R/FR light signaling in the dark. bZIP60 and bZIP28 may have antagonistic interactions related to control of abscisic acid signaling or water deprivation responses.",

    "results": "HZE radiation has a roughly 3:1 relative biological effectiveness (RBE) compared to gamma radiation in inhibiting primary root growth. Genomic instability, measured by loss of heterozygosity, was greater in seeds exposed to HZE particles than in those exposed to gamma rays. DNA repair-deficient lines (lig4 and ku80) exhibited decreased genomic stability. The relative importance of ATM and ATR differed in response to HZE versus gamma radiation.",
    "conclusions": "The complexity of DNA damage induced by radiation plays a role in DNA repair efficiency and accuracy. C-NHEJ is important in repairing both simple and complex DSBs.

    "methodology": "C57Bl6/J mice were flown to the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. Cardiac and lung tissues were collected and analyzed for protein and mRNA levels of cytoskeletal proteins using gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and quantitative PCR. Total DNA methylation levels were determined using restriction analysis. Control groups included basal, vivarium, and ground control mice.",
    "results": "No significant changes were observed in the cytoskeletal protein content in cardiac and lung tissue. However, mRNA expression levels of associated genes were significantly changed. Total DNA methylation was increased in both cardiac and lung tissue in the flight group. The mRNA content of cytosine demethylase Tet2 was significantly decreased in the flight group.",
    "conclusions": "Long-duration spaceflight induces changes in mRNA content and total genome methylation in mouse cardiac and lung tissue, without altering cytoskeletal protein content. Decreased Tet2 mRNA content may contribute to increased total methylation levels. Early period of readaptation may be more damaging than space flight itself.",
    "relationships": "The study suggests a relationship between spaceflight, changes in gene expression, increased DNA methylation, and the potential impact on cytoskeletal protein regulation.

    "objective": "To investigate the effects of spaceflight on murine muscle and bone GSK3 content and activation status, and to assess the impact of muscle-specific GSK3 inhibition on muscle size, strength, and bone mineral density under simulated microgravity.",
    "methodology": "Muscle and bone samples were obtained from mice exposed to spaceflight for 30-37 days across multiple missions (BION-M1, RR1, RR9, RR18). GSK3 content, phosphorylation, and muscle fiber type were analyzed. A muscle-specific GSK3 knockdown (GSK3mKD) mouse model was used to assess the effects of GSK3 inhibition on muscle and bone during hindlimb suspension (HLS) to simulate microgravity. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using DXA scans. Muscle contractility was assessed using an Aurora Scientific contractile apparatus. Western blotting was used to quantify protein expression.",
    "results": "Spaceflight reduced GSK3b content in soleus muscles, accompanied by a shift from slow-to-fast fiber types. Muscle-specific GSK3 knockdown increased soleus muscle size, myogenic signaling, and preserved muscle strength during HLS. GSK3mKD also increased tibia bone mineral density (BMD) and lumbar spine BMD, associated with increased FNDC5 in muscle.",
    "conclusions": "Spaceflight alters GSK3 content and activation in murine muscle and bone. Inhibiting GSK3 before muscle unloading, via muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion, can increase muscle mass, myogenic signaling, and preserve muscle force production. Muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion may also help maintain bone mass. Targeting GSK3 may offer musculoskeletal protection during spaceflight.",
    "relationships": "Inhibition of GSK3 in muscle promotes an oxidative fiber type shift and increases PGC-1a content, which can promote the expression and release of FNDC5 and irisin. Irisin, a myokine secreted from muscle, can positively impact bone mass and strength, even in the face of HLS. Muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased FNDC5 in muscle while also increasing BMD in the tibia and lumbar spine, highlighting a muscle-to-bone connection that would likely be activated with whole-body GSK3 inhibition through pharmacological means.",
    "insights": "Targeting GSK3 could represent a viable mitigation strategy against the musculoskeletal declines seen with spaceflight. Pharmacological inhibitors such as lithium (Li), which is an already FDA-approved drug, could be used to achieve GSK3 inhibition before and during spaceflight. Low-dose lithium supplementation augments myogenic differentiation and fusion, which could have implications for spaceflight.",

Mice were treated weekly with BuOE or saline. SERCA ATPase activity was assessed using an enzyme-linked spectrophotometric assay. Western blotting was performed on muscle homogenate to assess protein content for SERCA1a, SERCA2a, total and phosphorylated RYR, 4-HNE, SOD, SLN, NNAT, and PLN. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test.",
    "results": "Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio (SR Ca2+ leak) and 4-HNE content, none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. BuOE treatment increased SERCA’s apparent affinity for Ca2+. Spaceflight increased SERCA1a and SERCA2a protein content. Spaceflight tended to reduce SOD content and increase p-RYR. Spaceflight caused reductions in SLN, increases in NNAT, and reductions in PLN.",
    "conclusions": "Spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment, despite increases in SERCA's affinity for Ca2+. Future studies aimed at reducing Ca2+ leak or increasing SERCA activation could reveal SERCA and Ca2+ handling as viable targets to counteract weakness and atrophy observed with spaceflight.",
    "relationships": "Spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy is related to Ca2+ dysregulation, specifically increased SR Ca2+ leak. Increased RONS contribute to SERCA dysfunction. BuOE, while increasing SERCA's affinity for Ca2+, was unable to counteract the effects of spaceflight on muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak.",

Both neonatal and adult CPCs showed increased expression of DNA repair genes and enhanced migration. Neonatal CPCs showed a reduced ability to form endothelial-like tubes.",
    "conclusions": "Spaceflight exerts broad effects on the developmental status, proliferative potential, and migratory ability of CPCs, with age-dependent variations. Neonatal CPCs exhibit increased expression of early developmental markers, enhanced proliferative potential, and increased migratory capacity. Cytoskeletal modifications resulting from reduced mechanotransduction impart improved migratory and adhesion capabilities regardless of age. Recapitulating spaceflight-induced signaling events using clinorotation may represent an avenue for ongoing studies.",

    "insights": "Spaceflight induces a pre-cardiac mesoderm gene expression profile in neonatal CPCs. Both spaceflight and 2D clinorotation readily alter the developmental properties of neonatal CPCs, possibly through reduced mechanotransduction.

    "methodology": "Genomic data analyses were coupled with phenotypic characterization of E. faecalis isolates recovered onboard the ISS. Antibiotic resistance, desiccation tolerance, and pathogenicity were assessed using the C. elegans model. Pangenomic and phylogenetic analyses were performed, and comparative genomic analysis included MLST, plasmid detection, virulence factor detection, and CRISPR-Cas system analysis. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antibiotics were determined by broth microdilution. Desiccation survival was assessed by monitoring cell viability over three weeks. Pathogenicity was assessed using nematode killing assays.",
    "results": "ISS isolates exhibited varying degrees of antibiotic resistance, with some showing tetracycline resistance mediated by an acquired tetW/N/W gene. Desiccation tolerance was similar between ISS isolates and reference strains. In the C. elegans model, ISS isolates showed varying levels of pathogenicity, with some being less able to kill C. elegans than others. PathogenFinder predicted all ISS isolates as potential human pathogens, with scores higher than known clinical isolates.",
    "conclusions": "While genomic analysis alone is insufficient for accurate pathogenicity assessment, combining it with phenotypic characterization provides a framework.

    "objective": "To evaluate in vitro macrophage differentiation during space flight and test the hypothesis that the receptor expression for M-CSF, c-Fms, was reduced.",
    "methodology": "Mouse bone marrow cells were differentiated in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony stimulating factor (rM-CSF) during the flight of space shuttle STS-126. Flow cytometry was used to assess molecules on cells, and gene microarray was performed to analyze RNA.",
    "results": "Significant differences were found in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls on Earth. Changes were observed in the distribution of cells expressing CD11b, CD31, F4/80, Mac2, Ly6C, and c-Fos. There were no changes in c-Fms expression. Transcript levels suggested increased proliferation of bone marrow macrophages after 14 days of space flight. Space flight also influenced genes of the coagulation pathway.",
    "conclusions": "Space flight can impact the in vitro development of macrophages from mouse bone marrow cells, affecting cell proliferation, phenotype, and gene expression. The increased proliferation was not associated with a concomitant increase in glucose use, suggesting cells do not have to work as hard to grow in space. The changes do not appear to be from decreases in the surface expression of the receptor for M-CSF.",
    "relationships": "Space flight affects cells by inducing broad physiological changes and/or it can have direct gravitational impacts on the cells themselves. There is a strong correlation in expression between Csfr and Runx1.",
    "insights": "Space flight has a significant impact on murine bone marrow macrophages in vitro, leading to increased cell proliferation and changes in the pattern of expression of cell-surface differentiation antigens. The most interesting revelation of the IPA analysis of the transcriptional array of bone marrow macrophage differentiation in space was the broad impact of space flight on the coagulation pathway.",

    "objective": "To identify host genes that contribute to the replication of Ehrlichia chaffeensis, an obligate intracellular bacterium causing human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME).",
    "methodology": "Microarray analysis was performed on Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells to compare host gene transcript levels between permissive and nonpermissive conditions for E. chaffeensis growth. Mutant fly lines were screened for their ability to support Ehrlichia replication.  qRT-PCR was used to confirm bacterial load.  THP-1 cells were used to silence the human UCK2 gene.",
    "results": "Ten fly lines carrying mutations in the genes CG6479, separation anxiety, chitinase 11, CG6364 (Uck2), CG6543 (Echs1), withered (whd), CG15881 (Ccdc58), CG14806 (Apop1), CG11875 (Nup37), and dumpy (dp) had increased resistance to infection with Ehrlichia. Seven of these genes (san, Cht11, Uck2, Echs1, whd, Ccdc58, and Apop1) encoded proteins that had mitochondrial functions or could be associated with proteins with mitochondrial functions. Silencing of the human UCK2 gene affected E. chaffeensis replication in human macrophages. CPEC treatment increased E. chaffeensis infection. Cytosine treatment increases E. chaffeensis infection.",
    "conclusions": "Drosophila melanogaster can be used to investigate host factors important for E. chaffeensis replication.  Ten genes were identified that contribute to the replication of E. chaffeensis in vivo. Seven genes encode proteins that have mitochondrial functions. The uridine kinase must be essential to providing substrates for E. chaffeensis, because it cannot be provided by the de novo synthesis pathway. The clustering of mitochondria adjacent to morulae in E. chaffeensis-infected macrophages supports the hypothesis that it has physiological relevance.",
    "relationships": "Seven genes (san, Cht11, Uck2, Echs1, whd, Ccdc58, and Apop1) encode proteins that have mitochondrial functions, serve as substrates in the mitochondria, or are associated with proteins with mitochondrial functions. Cht11 is orthologous to the Chitinase 11 gene of Tribolium castaneum. whd gene was originally associated with uridine kinase. Echs1 in Drosophila is an ortholog of the ECHS1 gene in humans and other mammals. san is an ortholog of the human NAA50 gene. CG15881, or Ccdc58, is an ortholog of the human gene known as coiled-coil domain-containing protein 58 (CCDC58). CG14806 or Apopt1 has no known function in Drosophila. Uck2 (CG6364) is orthologous to the mammalian UCK2 gene with the molecular function of a uridine kinase.",
    "insights": "Mitochondrial function is critical for E. chaffeensis replication. The uridine/cytidine salvage pathway is required for E. chaffeensis replication. UCK2 has the potential to be a target for chemotherapy. E. chaffeensis may inhibit mitochondrial activity to inhibit the generation of mitochondrially produced oxidative products that would be harmful to the bacteria.",

Virus yield reduction, virucidal, and cell cytotoxicity experiments were performed on positive hits. Lead compounds were further characterized in dose-dependent assays, time-of-addition, time-of-removal, virus entry, and viral protein synthesis assays. The antiviral effects of the lead compounds on mitigating virulent ASFV infection in porcine macrophages (PAMs) were also tested, and the ability to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production was assessed by ELISA.",
    "results": "Five compounds inhibited ASFV-induced CPE by greater than 50%. Tetrandrine and berbamine exhibited high levels of anti-ASFV activity, inhibiting early stages of ASFV infection and infection of PAMs by the virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate. Both compounds reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines during ASFV infection in PAM cells, with tetrandrine having a greater and more sustained anti-inflammatory effect than berbamine.",
    "conclusions": "Dual-acting natural compounds with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties hold promise as preventative and therapeutic agents to combat ASFV infection by simultaneously inhibiting viral replication and reducing virus-induced cytokine production.",
    "relationships": "Tetrandrine and berbamine inhibit ASFV infection by blocking virus entry, disrupting viral attachment and internalization into host cells. They also reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, in ASFV-infected macrophages.",
    "insights": "Berbamine and tetrandrine possess dual inhibitory activities: potent antiviral activity against ASFV, primarily through disrupting viral entry mechanisms; and significant inhibition of virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

The Techshot bioreactor showed highest macrophage recovery when rotated in the horizontal plane. Cell surface phenotype varied depending on whether macrophages differentiated in FPAs or bioreactors. Cells proliferated more in space compared to ground-incubated cells. Significant shifts were observed in the distribution of cells expressing CD31, Ly6C, CD11b, F4/80, Mac-2, and c-fos in cells differentiated in space flight compared to ground controls.

RNA sequencing libraries were constructed and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. A bioinformatics workflow was developed using CLC Genomics Workbench, NCBI databases, and IMGT High-V Quest for data cleaning, mapping, and analysis of V, D, and J gene usage, CDR3 assembly, and mutation assessment.  The workflow was validated by comparing MiSeq data to existing murine antibody repertoire studies and by comparing reference mapping to whole genome mapping.",
    "results": "Size selection of RNA yielded the highest number of antibody sequences. V-gene segment usage was similar among cell, tissue, and size-selected treatment groups. D1-1 was the most frequently discovered D-gene segment. JH2 was the most frequently used J-gene segment. IgM was the most abundant heavy chain constant region. The tissue and size selected treatment groups contained most of the common CDR3s. Reference mapping and whole genome mapping showed strong correlation.",

D1-1 gene segment was the most common, and IgM was the most commonly identified constant region.",
    "conclusions": "This study presents a unique, non-primer biased glimpse of the conventionally housed, unimmunized antibody repertoire of the C57BL6/J mouse. An RNASeq approach without amplification can provide an accurate assessment of V-gene use as well as a snapshot of the CDR3 present in the population; and helps validate this as a reasonable scientific approach.",

    "results": "Lymphatic architecture was largely unchanged in both CavKO and LyCav mice. Lymphatic conductance and permeability to 70kDa dextran were significantly higher in both CavKO mice and LyCav mice. Transport within the lymphatic system to the sentinel node was significantly reduced. Isolated collecting vessel studies identified significantly reduced phasic contractility when lymphatic endothelium lacks caveolae. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase partially restored ex vivo vessel contractility.",
    "conclusions": "Macromolecule transport across lymphatics is increased with loss of caveolae, yet phasic contractility is reduced, resulting in reduced overall lymphatic transport function. Lymphatic caveolar biology is a key regulator of active lymphatic transport functions.",
    "relationships": "Caveolae are involved in multiple processes that control various aspects of lymphatic function. Deletion of Cav-1 has a dichotomous effect on different regions of the lymphatic network. Fluid or macromolecule uptake may be increased in the initial, peripheral lymphatic capillaries, but there is a downstream impairment of collecting vessel intrinsic capabilities when caveolae are absent.",
    "insights": "Caveolae play a role in cellular endo- and exocytosis, mechanosensing, and receptor localization that are particularly enriched in adipocytes and endothelial cells. Caveolae are involved in multiple process that control various aspects of lymphatic function. The intrinsic contraction rate and amplitude of lymphatic collecting vessels thus appears to be in part dependent on lymphatic endothelial cell caveolar functions.",

    "objective": "To determine the effects of microgravity on intrinsic vasomotor properties of mesenteric arteries and veins from mice flown on space shuttle missions, and to examine whether reductions in vasoconstrictor responsiveness persist after landing.",
    "methodology": "Mesenteric arteries and veins were isolated from female mice flown on space shuttle missions and ground-based control mice. Vasoconstrictor responses were evoked in arteries via norepinephrine (NE), potassium chloride (KCl), and caffeine, and in veins through NE across a range of intraluminal pressures. mRNA levels for ryanodine receptors were also analyzed.",
    "results": "Spaceflight diminished the magnitude and rapidity of mesenteric artery vasoconstriction to NE, KCl, and caffeine. Spaceflight also reduced arterial ryanodine receptor-3 mRNA levels. In mesenteric veins, there was diminished constriction to NE after flight. The impaired vasoconstriction persisted 1 day post-spaceflight but normalized after 5 days. Maximal diameter of mesenteric veins tended to be larger in the spaceflight mice.",
    "conclusions": "Spaceflight impairs vasoconstriction in mesenteric arteries and veins, potentially through a ryanodine receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release mechanism. These vascular changes could compromise the maintenance of arterial pressure during orthostatic stress upon return to Earth.",

    "methodology": "Six-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 7 or 14 days of hindlimb unloading (HU) or served as weight-bearing controls. Bone perfusion was measured following 10 minutes of reloading. Histomorphometry was used to determine PNA media wall thickness and maximal diameter. Arterial shear stress and circumferential wall stress were calculated.",
    "results": "Femoral perfusion was lower in the distal metaphyseal region of 7-day HU rats and in multiple regions of 14-day HU rats during reloading. Vascular resistance was higher in all regions of the femur in 14-day HU rats during reloading. Intraluminal diameter and medial wall thickness of PNAs from 14-day HU rats were smaller than those of controls. Decreases in both shear stress and circumferential stress occurred in the PNA with HU, later returning to control levels with reductions in PNA maximal diameter and wall thickness.",
    "conclusions": "Chronic skeletal unloading attenuates the ability to increase blood flow and nutrient delivery to bone and marrow with immediate acute reloading, due in part to a remodeling of the bone resistance vasculature. The remodeling of bone resistance arteries appears to be driven by alterations in mechanical forces within the arterial vasculature that were induced during the unloading treatment.",
    "relationships": "Skeletal unloading decreases long bone blood flow and impairs the ability of the vasculature to augment bone and marrow blood flow upon reloading.

    "methodology": "The study used Japanese quail embryos and adults. Techniques included scanning electron microscopy (SEM), immunohistochemistry, neural tracing with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), and anatomical reconstructions. Macular growth was measured using video microscopy. Hair cell planar polarity and density were determined from SEM micrographs. Apoptosis was assessed using the TUNEL method. Statistical analyses included ANOVA and Pearson correlations.",
    "results": "Otolith maculae epithelial areas increased exponentially during embryonic development. Hair cell density maturation rates were faster in striolar regions compared to extrastriolar regions. Stereocilia polarization was initiated early, with reversal zones forming at E8. Programmed cell death increased significantly at E14. Three afferent types (calyx, dimorph, bouton) exhibited specific regional distributions in the adult utricle. Bouton afferents develop first, followed by dimorph and then calyx afferents.",
    "conclusions": "Type II hair cells develop first, followed by type I hair cells. Planar cell polarity patterns migrate during embryogenesis to reach an adult topographic form. Bouton afferents develop first, with calyceal terminals forming later on dimorph afferents, and true calyx afferents appearing last. The regional distribution of afferent terminals in the adult quail utricle is similar to that reported for pigeons.",
    "relationships": "The study highlights the relationship between hair cell development, stereocilia polarization, and afferent innervation patterns in the vestibular system. It also suggests a possible trans-differentiation process where bouton fibers develop into dimorph units, and some dimorph fibers further differentiate into calyx afferents.",

    "methodology": "Extracellular recordings were obtained from single neurons in the vestibular nuclei of alert pigeons during sinusoidal rotational and translational stimuli. Earth-vertical axis (EVA) rotations were used to characterize neural responses to canal inputs. Linear translations were used to characterize responses to otolith inputs. Earth-horizontal axis (EHA) rotations were used to characterize responses to combined canal and otolith stimulation. Data analysis involved fitting sinusoidal functions to stimulus feedback and firing rate data to evaluate neural sensitivity and phase.",
    "results": "Convergent neurons in the VNC were sensitive to both rotational and linear translational motion. Canal-related spatial preferences were more closely related to behavior than to canal afferents. Convergent canal- and otolith-related responses were spatially aligned, such that both response components would be maximally stimulated by EHA rotation around the same axis. However, the sensitivity and phase values predicted for these inputs during EHA rotation were not matched.",
    "conclusions": "Convergent neurons in the pigeon VNC exhibit spatial alignment between canal and otolith inputs, but the sensitivity and phase values are mismatched. Linear summation of canal and otolith inputs does not accurately predict the net response to EHA rotation, suggesting nonlinear integration of these inputs.

A secondary goal was to examine proteomics based on samples preserved in RNAlater, a method widely used in ISS spaceflight biology research.",
    "methodology": "Arabidopsis seedlings from three GFP lines were grown on the ISS for 12 days and preserved in RNAlater.  Proteins were extracted from roots and leaves, digested, labeled with iTRAQ tags, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Data was processed using ProteinPilot and Proteome Discoverer software, and functional annotation was assigned using Blast2GO suite and the Arabidopsis functional catalog. Statistical analysis (Fisher's test) was used to determine differences in protein abundance between spaceflight and ground control samples.",
    "results": "Over 1500 proteins were identified in root and leaf samples.  256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins showed statistically significant differential abundance in spaceflight samples compared to ground controls.  Only 41 differentially abundant proteins were shared between roots and leaves. Functional analysis revealed distinct patterns between leaves and roots, with leaves showing upregulation of stress/defense, photosynthesis, and translation-related proteins, and roots showing increased abundance of proteins related to cofactor metabolism and oxidative stress responses.",

Spaceflight appears benign to auxin and its role in the development of the primary root tip, whereas spaceflight may influence cytokinin-associated processes. Plants in the microgravity of spaceflight establish an auxin distribution that is indistinguishable from that of a vertical orientation on Earth. The distribution of cytokinin was different in spaceflight as compared with ground control roots; plants on orbit showed a more restricted distribution of ARR5::GFP expression compared with ground controls.",
    "conclusions": "Auxin distributions of the primary root are not gravity dependent, even though these distributions are key to gravity responses.

    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6379395/",
    "objective": "To elucidate the contribution of two skewing- and cell wall-associated genes in Arabidopsis to root behavior and gene expression patterns in spaceflight, and to assess whether interruptions of different skewing pathways affect the overall spaceflight-associated process.",
    "methodology": "The Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 (APEX-03-2) spaceflight study was conducted on the International Space Station (ISS). Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and mutant lines (spr1 and sku5) were grown for 4 and 8 days in the Veggie hardware under constant lighting. Root growth morphologies were observed, and gene expression profiles were analyzed using RNA-Seq to measure the complexity of spaceflight acclimation. Ground controls were performed at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) using Veggie hardware within the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber.",
    "results": "The spr1 mutant showed enhanced leftward skewing in spaceflight compared to ground controls. The sku5 mutant did not show enhanced skewing in spaceflight. The spr1 mutant required fewer differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for spaceflight acclimation than its wild type, while sku5 showed considerably more DEGs than its wild type. Germination rates were repressed in FLT sku5 relative to GC sku5, and to FLT WS.",
    "conclusions": "The two skewing pathways highlighted by SKU5 and SPR1 differentially affect the mechanisms used by plants to physiologically acclimate to spaceflight. The spr1 mutation enhances spaceflight physiological adaptation, while the sku5 mutation initiates a more complex, deeper, and more stress-related response to spaceflight. Lipid raft nanodomains of the plasma membrane and their associated GPI-APs play important roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation.",
    "relationships": "SPR1 reinforces rightward root growth, while EB1b negatively regulates thigmotropism and positively regulates gravitropism. SKU5 may impact the spaceflight response via the regulation of meristematic competence and cell cycle progression. ABA signaling inhibits TOR, promoting autophagy to allow for stress tolerance acquisition.",
    "insights": "Root skewing in spaceflight appears to be an inherent feature of many Arabidopsis ecotypes, even in conditions lacking both light and gravity. The spaceflight environment imposes secondary environmental stresses due to the disruption of fluid movement, and any processes influenced by convection, such as gas exchange and temperature redistribution. The intensity of the differential gene expression response may be considered a measure of the metabolic cost of adapting to that environment.",

The microbiome is a hotspot for genetic transfer, facilitating the exchange of antibiotic resistance, food digestion and nutrient metabolism genes that may provide the microbe a competitive advantage within the host community. Understanding the nature and frequency of such events, as well as the overall stability of the microbiome under microgravity conditions, will not only help elucidate how microgravity alters this dynamic microbial landscape but will help enable the formation of new strategies for maintenance and potential restoration of the healthy microbiome during spaceflight.",

The increase in microvillar density at dawn in juveniles requires *V. fischeri* colonization, but is not dependent on the level of colonization or luminescence capacity of the symbionts. This increase in density is induced by phosphorylated lipid A.",
    "conclusions": "The remodelling of the crypt brush borders begins in juvenile animals and this activity requires influences from both an environmental light cue and interaction with the microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) of symbiont cells.

    "objective": "To determine the effects of isolation and simulated microgravity, alone or combined, on the inflammatory cytokine milieu of the hippocampus in mice, and to investigate the role of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in these responses.",
    "methodology": "Adult female wild-type and MCAT (mitochondrial catalase-overexpressing) mice were subjected to simulated microgravity via hindlimb unloading (HU) for 30 days, with single or social housing. Cytokine protein expression in the hippocampus and plasma was analyzed. Oxidative damage was assessed by measuring 4-HNE adduct levels. Plasma corticosterone levels were also measured.",
    "results": "Isolation and simulated microgravity each regulated a distinct set of cytokines in the hippocampus. Their combined effects were not additive. Overexpression of catalase in mitochondria protected against isolation- and/or simulated microgravity-induced changes in cytokine expression. Isolation increased oxidative damage in the hippocampus. Simulated microgravity upregulated IL-20 in plasma, an effect mitigated by catalase overexpression. Isolation affected Eotaxin and MDC levels in plasma. Corticosterone levels were generally higher in social groups compared to single-housed groups.",
    "conclusions": "Isolation and simulated microgravity induce distinct changes in hippocampal cytokine expression, with mitochondrial ROS playing a key role in mediating these responses. Antioxidant-based approaches may mitigate CNS risks associated with long-term space exploration, bedrest, and isolation on Earth.",
    "relationships": "Mitochondrial ROS signaling is implicated in neuroinflammatory responses to spaceflight stressors. Isolation can alter aspects of CNS immune signaling and lead to increased oxidative damage in the CNS. Cytokine responses to spaceflight stressors in the hippocampus versus circulation were discrete. Increased plasma corticosterone levels were observed in social housed mice even as plasma levels of an oxidative damage marker and a subset of inflammatory cytokine protein levels in the hippocampus generally decreased.",

    "results": "Spaceflight compromised the survival of healthy flies but not CI flies. Inflammation-related genes were activated in both fly strains. Tumor burden increased in space-returned CI flies. Spaceflight did not significantly impact wasp survival or virulence gene expression. Mutant wasps with altered wing color and shape were isolated post-flight.",
    "conclusions": "Spaceflight has differential effects on flies depending on their genetic background. Metazoan parasites can develop normally in space, retaining their infection strategies. Continued analysis of such systems will be important to help establish multigenerational studies and to obtain a fine-grained understanding of the long-term effects of space on diverse organisms.",
    "relationships": "The study examines the relationship between Drosophila melanogaster and parasitoid wasps, focusing on how spaceflight affects their interactions, including host immunity and parasite virulence. It also explores the relationship between gene expression changes and observed phenotypes in both hosts and parasites.",
    "insights": "Spaceflight can alter host-parasite interactions, with potential implications for astronaut health. The study highlights the importance of considering genetic background when assessing the effects of spaceflight on organisms. It also suggests that metazoan parasites may be more resilient to spaceflight than their hosts.",

    "objective": "To analyze the frequencies of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells exposed to X-ray or carbon ion under simulated microgravity (µG) conditions, and to assess the combined effects of radiation and µG on cell survival and CA.",
    "methodology": "Cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells were simultaneously exposed to X-ray or carbon ion irradiation under simulated µG using a 3D clinostat. Cell survival was assessed immediately after irradiation. Chromosome aberrations were analyzed 24 hours post-irradiation using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Statistical analyses, including Fisher’s exact test and logistic regression, were performed to determine the significance of observed differences.",
    "results": "Simultaneous exposure to radiation and µG resulted in a higher frequency of both simple and complex types of chromosome aberrations compared to radiation exposure alone. C-ion irradiation induced more complex CA than X-ray irradiation at the same cell survival fraction dose. Logistic regression analysis indicated that both radiation dose and gravity significantly contributed to total chromosome exchanges.",
    "conclusions": "Exposure to radiation under simulated microgravity increases chromosome aberrations in human lymphoblastic TK6 cells, suggesting that space radiation risk assessments based on 1G conditions may underestimate astronauts' potential health risks. The combined effects of ionizing radiation and µG are more than additive, increasing the risk of CA during long space flights.",
    "relationships": "The study builds upon previous research on the effects of space radiation and microgravity on cells, particularly focusing on DNA damage and repair mechanisms. It relates to the broader field of space biology and the assessment of astronaut health risks during long-duration space missions. The findings corroborate existing models of radiation risk uncertainties.",
    "insights": "The study highlights the importance of considering the combined effects of microgravity and space radiation when assessing astronaut health risks. It suggests that ground-based experiments under 1G conditions may not accurately reflect the biological effects of space radiation. Further research is needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of increased chromosome aberrations under simulated microgravity and to develop effective countermeasures.",

Strain fitness was assessed by quantifying barcode abundance using next-generation sequencing. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed to identify biological processes significantly affected by spaceflight. The effects of spaceflight were compared against a database of drug effects on yeast to identify concordant mechanisms of perturbation.",
    "results": "In spaceflight, the homozygous deletion collection revealed the importance of processes linked to mitochondria, while the heterozygous collection highlighted genes involved in regulating translation and ribosomal RNA transport. Both homozygous and heterozygous collections highlighted DNA repair. With the addition of NaCl, the homozygous collection also revealed the importance of RNA-related processes including ribosome assembly and biogenesis and mRNA processing and decay, as well as modification of tRNAs. Spaceflight effects showed high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents and changes in redox state.",

DNA repair and replication, response to pH signaling, control of gene expression, and mitochondrial function are also significantly affected. DNA and RNA damage are major ground-based analogs of spaceflight stress, likely due to radiation exposure. Increased glutathione S-transferase activity and changes in redox state are also implicated.",
    "relationships": "Spaceflight stress is related to DNA damage and redox state changes. The addition of salt stress potentiates the DNA-damaging effects of spaceflight, possibly via the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The effects of spaceflight are similar to those of nucleotide analogs and DNA-damaging agents.",
    "insights": "Spaceflight induces DNA and RNA damage, affecting core cellular processes. Countermeasures targeting DNA repair, redox balance, and mitochondrial function may mitigate the negative effects of spaceflight on cellular health. The study provides a platform for conducting full genome environmental screens in spaceflight.",

    "methodology": "Giant yeast colonies were cultured in true microgravity (spaceflight) and simulated microgravity (rotation and random positioning) on both nutrient-rich (YPD) and nutrient-poor (YE) media. Gene expression (using eGFP fusion protein expression clones), cell death (necrosis and apoptosis via PI and Annexin V staining), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were measured using flow cytometry. Stress promoter dependence was assessed by comparing eGFP signal of parent strains to clones with Msn4 or Sfp1 promoter deletions. Statistical analysis included ANOVA and Tukey’s test.",
    "results": "Microgravity increased both select reactive oxygen species and stress defense genes (INO1, TRR1, SSA4) independent of media type. SSA4 expression increased in flight and was Sfp1-dependent. RPL34B increased in flight with Msn4 dependence on YE media. Cell death by necrosis and apoptosis increased in flight. Rotating wall vessel and random positioning models showed different effects compared to spaceflight, indicating distinct stimuli.",
    "conclusions": "True microgravity induces unique cellular responses in yeast colonies compared to simulated microgravity, particularly regarding ammonia signaling, stress defense, and cell death. The rotating wall vessel and random positioning models induce distinct forces. Physical methods can manipulate yeast colony redox, apoptosis, and stress defense status, offering insights into drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.",
    "relationships": "Ammonia signaling is increased when generated ammonia cannot convect away from the colonies. Increased expression of the stress defense dependent SSA4 gene is consistent with lack of oxygen availability and carbon dioxide accumulation as these gasses are also affected by the lack of convection. Cell death was greatly increased by deletion of either of the stress responsive promoters Msn4 or Sfp1.",

Behavioral tests, femur micro-CT, brain transcriptomics, serum metabolomics, and fecal microbiomics were performed. Statistical analysis included Two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests.",
    "results": "Clinostat-treated mice showed decreased activity, altered gait, enhanced fear memory, bone loss, immune/endocrine changes in brain transcriptome, and altered metabolic pathways in serum and gut microbiota. 3D clinostat treatment significantly reduced mice activity and exploratory desire. There were no statistically significant differences in learning and memory. Prolonged exposure to the 3D clinostat had a notable impact on the vestibular balance system. The 3D clinostat seemed to induce a trend towards increased sensitivity to fear behavior and enhanced fear memory. Both SB and CS group of mice exhibited significant bone loss compared to the MC group, with a notable decrease in bone volume and trabecular number, as well as a significant increase in trabecular pattern factor and trabecular separation. 3D clinostat may primarily affect immune and endocrine-related signaling pathways. The CS group exhibited significant upregulation of serum metabolites. The Bacteroides and Turicibacter were significantly reduced in the CS group compared to both the SB and MC groups.",
    "conclusions": "The model closely mimics spaceflight-induced transcriptome changes, suggesting its value in studying microgravity-related neurological alterations and highlighting the need for attention to emotional changes in space. The 3D clinostat model demonstrates a closer resemblance to the brain transcriptome expression profiles observed in spaceflight animals, thereby offering a novel and invaluable research tool for simulating microgravity effect on Earth.",
    "relationships": "The 3D clinostat model appears to more closely mimic the gene expression changes seen in real spaceflight, particularly in terms of immune and endocrine-related pathways. The CS and FL models demonstrated a convergent alteration in three KEGG signaling pathways: GnRH signaling pathway, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and Ovarian steroidogenesis, as well as eight common differential genes. The HU model demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to alterations in cerebral blood flow, rendering it an appropriate choice for investigating notable cognitive shifts following return from spaceflight, while the 3D clinostat model is more likely to focus on subtle cognitive changes caused by adaptation to microgravity in space, which may be related to vestibular function and spatial orientation.",
    "insights": "Simulated microgravity effect induced by the 3D clinostat triggered noteworthy transformations within the central nervous system. This model has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for investigating cognitive changes associated with microgravity environments, while also offering new insights into the potential mechanisms underlying spaceflight-related health risks. Microgravity may have a more pronounced impact on emotional and motivational states than on cognitive functions, highlighting the need for further research into the psychological well-being of astronauts during extended missions.",

    "results": "LOCM showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect under static and low-to-moderate shear stress conditions, significantly higher than IOCM. High shear stress reduced cell viability in IOCM. The high viscosity of IOCM slowed fluid flow and augmented fluid shear stress. LOCM inhibited Erk1/2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, while IOCM did not significantly alter signaling molecule expression.",
    "conclusions": "Viscosity-induced nephrotoxicity plays a vital role under high shear-stress conditions. The kidney-on-a-chip model reliably reflects in vivo situations. Under high-shear-stress conditions, IOCM caused renal tubular cell damage comparable to LOCM, decreasing the urine flow rate and exposing cells to high shear-stress for a longer duration.",
    "relationships": "Increased viscosity of contrast media contributes to tubular cell damage through flow-derived stresses such as tubular stretching, increased shear stress, and transmural pressure. High viscosity of IOCM is associated with increased tubular pressure, prolonged CM retention, and subsequent decreased GFR and hypoxia.",
    "insights": "The study suggests an alternative in vitro model of CIN using a three-dimensional proximal tubule-on-a-chip. The risk of CIN may not differ significantly between IOCM and LOCM in patients with CKD under high shear-stress conditions.

    "objective": "To analyze the lumbar spine’s response to backpack loads with upright MRI in children with idiopathic low back pain (ILBP) and compare their results to previously published data from normal children under the same conditions. The hypothesis is that typical backpack loads will have a different effect on the lumbar spine of normal and ILBP children.",
    "methodology": "A repeated measures design was used, imaging fifteen pediatric and adolescent patients with ILBP using a 0.6T upright MRI scanner while supine and standing wearing 0 kg, 4 kg, and 8 kg backpacks. IVD height, lumbar lordosis, lumbar coronal deformity, and pain score were recorded after each condition and compared using ANOVAs. Generalized least squares models were used to compare variables between ILBP and normal subjects.",
    "results": "In ILBP children, 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks compressed the L5-S1 IVD relative to upright with no load. Subjects experienced increasing pain with increasing load. Load had no effect on lumbar lordosis or lumbar coronal deformity. Compared to normal children, ILBP children experienced significantly less disc compression at T12-L1 to L4-5, less lumbar lordosis, and more pain with increasing load.",
    "conclusions": "In ILBP children, increasing backpack load compresses only the L5-S1 IVD. Compared to normal children, ILBP children experience less lumbar IVD compression, less lumbar lordosis, and more pain due to increasing load, suggesting altered mechanisms for load tolerance in ILBP children.",
    "relationships": "Increasing backpack load was positively associated with disc compression at L1-L2, L4-L5, and L5-S1. Pain positively correlated with backpack load.",
    "insights": "Children with ILBP may alter the distribution of backpack load from the IVDs to the surrounding paraspinal musculature, leading to muscle fatigue and subsequent pain. Physical therapy aimed at paraspinal muscle strengthening may normalize back pain with loading and redistribute the load to the IVDs.",

    "methodology": "Caudal motion segments from mice returned from a 30-day spaceflight mission and ground controls were subjected to four-point bending until failure. Histology was used to determine failure location, and micro-computed tomography (μCT) was used to quantify bone properties.",
    "results": "Spaceflight significantly shortened the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve and reduced bending strength. Flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone, while controls tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness.",
    "conclusions": "Vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may degrade spine bending properties and contribute to increased disc herniation risk in astronauts. The shift in failure location from the endplate junction in controls to the growth plate in flight mice suggests a weakening of the growth plate and epiphyseal bone due to microgravity.",

    "methodology": "Two strains of M. marinum (1218R and LHM4) were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) using a rotary cell culture system subjected to LSMMG or normal gravity (NG). Bacterial growth, size, transcriptome changes (RNA-Seq), and resistance to stress (hydrogen peroxide, gamma radiation, pH 3.5) were assessed after short (~40 h) and long (4 days + ~35 h) exposure times.",
    "results": "M. marinum exposed to LSMMG transitioned from exponential phase earlier than the NG culture. They were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but showed no change in resistance to gamma radiation or pH 3.5. RNA-Seq detected altered transcript levels for several genes under LSMMG. LSMMG induced a reduction in translation, a downregulation of metabolism, an increase in lipid degradation, and increased chaperone and mycobactin expression. Sigma factor H (sigH) transcript was induced by LSMMG after both short and long exposure times.",
    "conclusions": "LSMMG may simulate a nutrient-deprived environment similar to that found within macrophage during infection. SigH is implicated in the M. marinum LSMMG transcriptome response.

    "results": "Vertical clinorotation reduced root growth by approximately 7%, while horizontal clinorotation did not affect it.  Curvature in horizontally clinorotated roots increased with increasing speed of rotation, but decreased in vertically clinorotated roots. The gravity signal persisted for about 2 hours, and the gravitropic signal saturated after 10 minutes of reorientation.",
    "conclusions": "Angular velocity and direction of clinorotation influence the graviresponse mechanism in roots. The gravity signal persists for approximately 2 hours, and a 10-minute reorientation is sufficient to saturate the gravitropic signal. Differences in curvature between vertical and horizontal clinorotation provide opportunities to identify processes that contribute to differential elongation.",

    "methodology": "Cauliflower seeds were subjected to hydropriming, halopriming (NaCl), and osmopriming (thiourea, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and proline) treatments. Seeds were immersed in solutions for 12 hours, then dried. Germination and growth parameters were measured under saline conditions (100 mM NaCl). Photosynthetic attributes, protein, proline, and MDA content were also estimated. Statistical analysis included ANOVA, Tukey HSD test, cluster analysis, and PCA.",
    "results": "Salt stress significantly reduced seed germination metrics. Priming treatments, especially with PEG, improved germination and growth parameters under salinity. Correlation analysis revealed relationships between germination traits. PCA showed that PEG treatments had increased germination indices. Cluster analysis grouped priming treatments based on their effectiveness. Priming increased protein and proline content and reduced MDA content. Photosynthetic pigments were better preserved in primed seedlings.",
    "conclusions": "Hydro-, halo-, and osmo-priming strategies improve germination indices and morpho-physiological traits of cauliflower under salt stress. Proline accumulation lowers MDA levels and alleviates lipid peroxidation, while increasing total soluble protein and photosynthetic pigments. Priming accelerates germination, synchronizes growth, and activates metabolites under high NaCl levels. Simple priming treatments can improve cauliflower crop performance.",

    "methodology": "Isolated Pleopeltis fronds were subjected to heat treatment (24h in darkness) in both dehydrated and hydrated conditions. Photosynthetic performance was assessed by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence and quantum yield. Membrane permeability was deduced from conductivity of water in which fronds were submersed. Metabolic activity was assessed via resazurin reduction. Hydroperoxide and lipid peroxide content were measured using FOX assays. Catalase activity and glutathione consumption were also determined. Fatty acid analysis was performed using gas chromatography.",
    "results": "Dried fronds curled tighter with increasing temperature. Exposure to 55°C resulted in patchy browning, and 65°C caused complete discoloration after rehydration. Hydrated fronds showed browning at temperatures > 40°C. Photosynthetic performance (Ft and Qy) decreased with higher temperatures, with Qy being a better indicator of heat stress. Electrolyte leakage increased significantly at temperatures ≥ 40°C. The hydroperoxide content of dried fronds increased gradually with temperature, while fully and partly submersed fronds showed highest values at 35°C. Catalase activity declined with increasing temperatures. Fatty acid composition changed with temperature and hydration, with linolenic acid being the dominant fatty acid.",
    "conclusions": "Dehydration protects Pleopeltis polypodioides from heat damage, with dried fronds tolerating up to 55°C, while hydrated fronds are limited to 40°C. Heat stress causes oxidative stress, membrane damage, and changes in fatty acid composition. The study illustrates the adaptability of this epiphytic fern to cope with environmental stress.",
    "relationships": "Heat stress induces changes in morphology, cellular functions, metabolism, and gene expression. Desiccation and heat induce changes in cell wall and frond shape. Discolorations of hydrated fronds indicate stress beyond thermal tolerance, leading to chloroplast or chlorophyll degradation. Electrolyte leakage indicates cell membrane damage and ion efflux. The extent of unsaturation correlated with peroxidation.",
    "insights": "The study highlights the importance of desiccation tolerance in the resurrection fern Pleopeltis polypodioides. The data indicate that > 40°C causes heat stress in Pleopeltis fronds.

    "methodology": "The transcription levels of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5, and ARG1 were compared in vertically and horizontally reoriented hypocotyls of Brassica rapa using tissue extraction and Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE). Ubiquitin (UBQ1) transcription level was used as a reference.  The hypocotyls were dissected into two parts (left/right for vertical controls and upper/lower for horizontally oriented seedlings). Samples obtained after 48 h did not include tissue samples as the tissue size after 48 h of additional growth exceeded the extraction capacity. The apical two mm of the root tip were removed using a scalpel and used as additional reference tissue.",
    "results": "Transcription of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5, and ARG1 varied during the graviresponse. PIN3, IAA5, and ARG1 were downregulated along the top flank but upregulated in the bottom tissue. PIN1 transcription did not change during the first four hours but after 11 h of reorientation increased in the lower flank and decreased along the upper flank. After 48 h, the transcription expression was reversed, i.e., transcription was upregulated in the upper flank and downregulated in the lower flanks.",
    "conclusions": "Basal hypocotyl curvature depends on auxin-mediated processes and involves the same genes for downward or upward curvature that were found to be involved in root curvature.

Transcription analysis of 16 genes related to growth, metabolism, auxin, and stress was performed using qPCR.",

Transcription analysis showed that weightlessness and clinorotation affected the expression of genes related to starch metabolism, particularly AMY1.",
    "conclusions": "Plants perceive weightlessness and adjust their metabolism, specifically starch production in gravity-perceiving cells. HGMFs can induce curvature, but hydrotropism is also a significant factor. The size and mass of amyloplasts are regulated by the extent of gravitational and mechanical stimulation, influencing gravisensitivity.",
    "relationships": "Weightlessness leads to increased amyloplast size and enhanced gravisensitivity. Clinorotation (enhanced mechanostimulation) leads to reduced amyloplast size through enhanced amylase transcription. HGMFs can induce curvature, but the effect is less pronounced than the effects of weightlessness and clinorotation on amyloplast metabolism.",
    "insights": "Plants adapt to weightlessness by increasing amyloplast size, suggesting a mechanism for enhanced gravisensitivity in space.

    "objective": "To investigate whether eukaryotic plasma membrane-localized MscS homologs form mechanosensitive channels and to compare their electrophysiological behavior with that of other MscS homologs, specifically focusing on Arabidopsis MSL10.",
    "methodology": "Heterologous expression and characterization of Arabidopsis MSL10 in Xenopus laevis oocytes using single-channel patch clamp electrophysiology. This involved injecting oocytes with MSL10 cRNA, excising membrane patches, and measuring channel activity in response to membrane stretch under various ionic conditions and in the presence of inhibitors.",
    "results": "MSL10 forms a mechanosensitive channel in the plasma membrane of Xenopus oocytes with a conductance of approximately 100 pS. The channel exhibits a moderate preference for anions and is reversibly inhibited by gadolinium ions. MSL10 demonstrates asymmetric activation/inactivation kinetics, closing at lower tensions than it opens.",
    "conclusions": "MSL10 provides a stretch-activated channel activity and is likely to represent the activity described in the root protoplasts of Arabidopsis. The electrophysiological characteristics of MSL10 provide insight into the evolutionary conservation of structure and function between MscS homologs.",
    "relationships": "MSL10 shares similarities with MSC1 and MscM in terms of unitary channel conductance, MSC1 in terms of ion selectivity, and MSC1 and MscS G113A/MscS 121A in terms of gating kinetics. MSL10 is likely to represent the activity described in the root protoplasts of a msl9-1;msl10-1 double mutant transiently expressing MSL10.",
    "insights": "The study suggests that MSL10 opening could lead to the depolarization of the cellular membrane via Cl− efflux, potentially activating other ion channels and participating in intercellular signaling. This indicates that some members of the MscS family may not only release osmolytes but also alter cell physiology.",

    "results": "S1PR3 KO mice displayed a dramatic loss of mechanical sensitivity. Peripheral blockade of S1PR3 signaling or S1P production impaired mechanical sensitivity. S1PR3 is expressed in A mechanonociceptors and thermal nociceptors. S1P activates thermal nociceptors but not putative AMs. S1PR3 modulates KCNQ2/3 channels to regulate AM excitability. S1PR3 is required for nociceptive responses of high-threshold AM nociceptors. S1PR3 is required for inflammatory pain hypersensitivity.",
    "conclusions": "S1P signaling via S1PR3 is a key pathway that tunes mechanical pain sensitivity by modulating KCNQ2/3 channel activity in AM neurons. Baseline levels of S1P are necessary and sufficient for setting normal mechanical pain thresholds, while elevated S1P levels promote thermal, but not mechanical hypersensitivity.",

    "results": "msl2 msl3 mutants develop callus at the shoot apex, associated with enlarged plastids, increased cytokinin levels, upregulation of WUSCHEL, downregulation of ARR7 and ARR15, and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Callus formation requires the cytokinin receptor AHK2, ABA biosynthesis, GUN1, and ABI4. Preventing proline biosynthesis enhances callus formation and ROS accumulation.",
    "conclusions": "Plastid osmotic stress influences cell differentiation at the shoot apex through two non-redundant pathways: the cytokinin/WUSCHEL feedback loop and a retrograde signaling pathway involving ROS, ABA, ABI4, and GUN1. These pathways coordinate proliferation versus differentiation signals at the organellar level.",

    "methodology": "Immunohistochemistry and volumetric image analyses were used to quantify synapse distributions across representative utricular regions in specimens from mice exposed to spaceflight.  Synapses were identified as closely apposed pre- and postsynaptic puncta using anti-CtBP2 and anti-Shank1A.  Epithelia from horizontal semicircular canal cristae served as within-specimen controls, and utricles and cristae from Earth-bound cohorts served as experimental controls. Confocal microscopy was used for imaging and synapse quantification.",
    "results": "Synapse densities decreased in the medial extrastriolae of microgravity specimens compared with experimental controls, whereas they were unchanged in the striolae and horizontal cristae from the two conditions. Hair cell densities remained similar in both control and microgravity conditions.",
    "conclusions": "Structural plasticity was topographically localized to the utricular region that encodes very low frequency and static changes in linear acceleration, demonstrating the capabilities of utricular hair cells for synaptic plasticity in adapting to novel gravitational environments.  The synaptic modifications were induced by alteration in the static load acting on the region of the utricle that normally encodes static linear acceleration stimuli.",
    "relationships": "Spaceflight imposes a different sensory environment on the inner ear utricle. The medial extrastriola, associated with encoding static head position, showed decreased synapse density, congruent with decreased utricular function in astronauts post-spaceflight.  The findings suggest a 'use it or lose it' plasticity guideline, where reduced sensory activity leads to a reduction in synapses.",
    "insights": "Adult utricular hair cells can undergo synaptic modifications in response to altered gravitational environments.  Synaptic plasticity in medial extrastriola hair cells resulted from the loss of synaptic specializations. The study suggests potential mechanisms for inner ear rehabilitation by inducing synapse density increases in vestibular paresis.",

    "results": "Higher angular frequency during clinorotation inhibited cell spreading. Cells at 75 rpm remained viable and re-spread after clinorotation. Clinorotation did not alter migration patterns in elongated cells, but most clinorotated cells exhibited cell retraction, compromising motility.",
    "conclusions": "hMSCs respond to clinorotation by adopting more rounded morphologies. The angular frequency-dependence suggests that a cell’s ability to sense the changing gravity vector is governed by the rate of perturbation. Cells cultured in clinorotated chemotaxis chambers were generally less motile and exhibited retraction instead of migration.",

    "conclusions": "Gravitational mechanical unloading affects inflammatory and adhesion molecules expression in ECs towards an 'anti-inflammatory' phenotype. This is coupled with an increase in eNOS and caveolin gene expression. Changes in gene expression and morphology are tightly linked to gravitational mechanical forces, with a possible role for caveolins. Artificial gravity may improve the effects of microgravity.",
    "relationships": "Mechanical unloading alters the cytoskeleton of ECs, leading to disorganization of actin filaments. This may impair the transport of molecules, such as caveolins, to the plasma membrane. The changes in inflammation, adhesion molecules, eNOS, and caveolins are likely mediated through changes in the cytoskeleton.",
    "insights": "Microgravity may have a beneficial impact on the health of blood vessels by inducing an anti-inflammatory phenotype in endothelial cells. The findings suggest that manipulating cell phenotype using gravitational forces could be a potential therapeutic approach for cardiovascular diseases. The changes in vascular ECs could be involved in the overall changes in the immune system seen with spaceflight.",

Tissue-specific RNAs identified space environmental responses in previously uncharacterized tissue types. These findings provide insights into previously uncharacterized tissue types and molecular processes in the human body affected by spaceflight.",

    "objective": "To investigate the effects of multiple hindlimb unloading (HLU) and reambulation (RA) cycles on body composition, lumbar bone mineral density, and muscle cross-sectional area in mice.",
    "methodology": "Adult male mice were subjected to one, two, or three cycles of 2 weeks of hindlimb unloading followed by 4 weeks of reambulation. Changes in adipose tissue, lean tissue, bone mineral density, and muscle cross-sectional area were longitudinally tracked using in vivo micro-CT. Ex vivo micro-CT was used to assess trabecular bone micro-architecture.",
    "results": "Multiple unloading cycles attenuated the change in adipose, lean, and bone tissue during the final unloading cycle. Total adipose tissue and vertebral bone mineral density recovered to control levels after reambulation, irrespective of the number of unloading cycles. Muscle cross-sectional area was lower in all unloaded groups compared to controls after reambulation. Loss of abdominal adipose tissue was associated with loss of bone mineral density.",
    "conclusions": "Multiple hindlimb unloading/reambulation cycles were not more detrimental to abdominal adipose, lean, and vertebral bone tissue than a single unloading period. Tissues can modulate their response to unloading based on previous unloading history. The lumbar vertebrae are more capable of recovering during reambulation periods than the peripheral skeleton.",
    "relationships": "A moderate association was found between the loss of bone and the loss of abdominal adipose tissue during unloading. No association was observed between the loss of abdominal lean tissue and the loss of bone.",
    "insights": "The study suggests that the body adapts to repeated unloading cycles, potentially reaching a basal level where further losses are attenuated. The differential recovery of lumbar vertebrae compared to the peripheral skeleton highlights the importance of considering the specific mechanical loading environment when designing countermeasures for bone loss.",

    "methodology": "A mouse model was used where mice were subjected to treadmill running.

Flow cytometry was used to quantify marrow-derived MSCs in the femur and humerus.",

Exercise led to significant enhancements of diaphyseal bone areas and moments of area in the ulna, femur, and tibia, but not in the humerus or radius.

    "methodology": "Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were grown on the International Space Station (ISS) using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). Seedlings were exposed to different gravity conditions (microgravity, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, and 1g) and illuminated with red light, blue light, or red light followed by blue light.

Red-light pretreatment enhanced the blue-light phototropic response in roots. Positive phototropic curvature in roots exposed to red light decreased as gravity increased. Hypocotyls showed significant phototropic responses to light, but no significant effect from gravity. Seedling position relative to the light source significantly affected phototropic curvature.",

The threshold model for the blue-light-positive phototropic response suggests that gravity levels between 0g and 0.1g eliminate the response.

    "objective": "To investigate the role of redox signaling in neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSμ) translocation and muscle fiber atrophy resulting from short-term (54 h) hindlimb unloading in rats, using EUK-134, a cell-permeable mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase.",
    "methodology": "Fischer-344 rats were divided into ambulatory control, hindlimb-unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded + EUK-134 (HU-EUK) groups. The soleus muscle was analyzed using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, Western immunoblot, and fiber-type analysis. Oxidative stress was assessed via 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) levels. nNOSμ localization, FoxO3a phosphorylation, and Nox2 subunit expression were also evaluated.",
    "results": "EUK-134 mitigated unloading-induced muscle fiber atrophy and fiber-type shift from slow to fast. It also abolished nNOSμ translocation from the sarcolemma to the cytosol and mitigated dephosphorylation of FoxO3a. Hindlimb unloading elevated oxidative stress and increased sarcolemmal localization of Nox2 subunits, effects normalized by EUK-134. EUK-134 reduced muscle fiber atrophy primarily in Type I fibers but offered no protection in Type IIa and Type IIb/d fibers.",

Redox signaling may serve as a biological switch for nNOS to initiate morphological changes in skeletal muscle fibers. EUK-134, by mitigating oxidative stress, can ameliorate these unloading-induced changes.",

    "conclusions": "CAMDLES provides a framework for novel hypothesis generation and design of biological experiments with RWVs, coupling the effects of RWV size, rotation rate, and mass transport directly to bacterial growth in microbial communities. The model can be used to explore experimental variables and demystify inconsistencies seen in microbial communities between RWVs and microgravity.",
    "relationships": "The study focused on the interactions between microbial cells and their environments at relevant spatial scales, particularly the exchange of metabolites between species. The model simulated a community composed of two obligately cross-feeding bacterial species (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica).",
    "insights": "Microgravity-induced alterations in the fluid environment are a major factor in the microbial experience of spaceflight. Computational modeling is needed to investigate how well ground-based microgravity simulation methods replicate that experience. The spatial structure of microbial communities significantly influences their ability to exchange metabolites and grow. RWVs generally amplify the spatial importance of this multispecies microbial community, leading to different aggregation sizes and population ratios.",

    "methodology": "A 7-week hardware validation test was conducted using the APH with Arabidopsis and wheat plants. The APH's ability to control environmental factors (light, humidity, CO2, temperature, and root zone moisture) was examined. Experiment profiles were executed to schedule environmental changes, photographic events, and experimental sequences. Gas exchange measurements were taken to assess canopy photosynthesis and respiration.",
    "results": "The APH successfully controlled environmental conditions and grew Arabidopsis and wheat plants in microgravity. The APH was able to measure gas exchange of plants from non-invasive gas exchange measurements. The APH ECS filter system successfully contained plant debris during harvest. The daily canopy photosynthetic rates measured in APH were compared to two wheat canopy photosynthetic experiments. The first is a wheat ground study conducted at a light intensity of 500 µmol m−2 s−1 using High Pressure Sodium (HPS) lamps. The second study is the 2002 PESTO spaceflight experiment conducted in the BPS using Cool White Fluorescent (CWF) lamps at a light intensity of 280 µmol m−2 s−1.",

    "methodology": "Phenomics analysis was used to monitor photosynthetic performance and growth of wild-type and ADT knockout mutants. Metabolomics analyses using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were performed to quantify secondary metabolites. Real-time atmospheric monitoring mass spectrometry was used to evaluate net CO2 uptake rates.  Electrochromic shift measurements were used to measure proton motive force. Starch content was also measured.",
    "results": "Reduced ADT activity impaired photosynthetic ATP consumption, leading to increased ATP/ADP ratio, starch overaccumulation, and lower electron transport rates. Flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, lignan, and glucosinolate contents were reduced in ADT mutants, while galactolipids and apocarotenoids increased. No significant difference was found in respiration and carbon fixation rates between wild type and extreme ADT knockout mutants.",
    "conclusions": "Altered ADT activity and phenylalanine metabolism have profound effects on secondary metabolites and photosynthesis. Reduced metabolism through phenylalanine impacts photosynthetic electron transport due to impaired recycling of ADP + Pi. Metabolic engineering of lignin biosynthesis could be a viable strategy to improve biofuel crops, but further improvements in ATP consumption are needed.",
    "relationships": "Reduced carbon flux into Phe biosynthesis impairs ATP consumption, leading to starch accumulation. Higher starch accumulation is accompanied by lower linear photosynthetic electron flux. Reduced phenylpropanoid biosynthesis leads to reduced consumption of fixed carbon and ATP, impacting electron transport rates.",
    "insights": "Modulating ADT activity significantly alters carbon allocation and energy balance within the plant. The study reveals interconnected consequences for photosynthesis and secondary metabolism, suggesting that engineering one pathway alone may not be sufficient for improving certain traits and that further improvements of ATP consumption can be a follow-up approach to make ADT mutants an interesting model for the improvement of, for example, biofuel conversion efficiencies.",

Transcriptome and proteome data were collapsed into gene ortholog (GO) data. Network analysis of enzymes correlated to stem lignin levels was performed.",
    "results": "Network analysis deduced the involvement of novel putative lignin related proteins or processes, including those associated with ribosomes, the spliceosome, mRNA transport, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, and phosphorylation. Significant changes were detected in glucosinolate, α-linolenic acid, nitrogen, carotenoid, aromatic amino acid, phenylpropanoid, and photosynthesis-related metabolic pathways in ADT KO mutants. Putative carotenoid and galactolipid levels were generally increased, whereas many glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids were decreased in the KO mutants.",
    "conclusions": "Lignin biosynthesis regulation involves additional post-transcriptional and translational level processes. The findings identify new protein targets for further biochemical analysis and/or plant bioengineering, leading to more accurate depictions of lignin/phenylpropanoid biosynthesis models. Vascular plant lignin levels are not only controlled at the point of transcription but work together with modulating factors at a post-transcriptional and translational level.",
    "relationships": "There are strong ties between glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids, with lignin being synthesized in the phenylpropanoid pathway. Phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), synthesized from Trp, can affect changes in growth, development and metabolism. Jasmonic acid (JA) levels have a strong relationship to lignin levels. JA-isoleucine and ROS production could form a negative feedback loop which can then repress each other’s production and influence lignin accumulation.",
    "insights": "ADT mRNA expression between ADT3, ADT4, and ADT5 seemed to be coordinated, as remaining ADTs in the ADT3/ADT4/ADT5 subgroup increased when other subgroup members were knocked out. Lignin levels may be in part regulated by a ribosome filter or “ribocode.” Lignin biosynthesis regulation may be associated with presence of specific ribosomal subunits involved in translation of lignin-biosynthesis-associated mRNA.",

    "objective": "To evaluate the impact of simulated microgravity and low-dose/dose-rate γ-irradiation on cardiac tissue, specifically assessing markers of oxidative stress, DNA methylation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and remodeling.",
    "methodology": "Female mice were exposed to hindlimb unloading (HU) to simulate microgravity, low-dose-rate γ-irradiation, or a combination of both for 21 days. Cardiac tissue was collected at 7 days, 1 month, 4 months, and 9 months post-exposure. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to measure oxidative stress and methylation markers. Immunoblot analysis was performed to determine protein content. Histology was used to assess inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen deposition. Real-time PCR was used to assess mRNA expression.",
    "results": "The combination of HU and γ-irradiation demonstrated the strongest increase in reduced to oxidized glutathione ratios 7 days and 1 month after treatment, but a difference was no longer apparent after 9 months. Inflammatory marker, CD-2 protein content was significantly decreased in all groups 4 months after treatment. No significant differences were observed in α-smooth muscle cell actin protein content, collagen type III protein content or % total collagen.",
    "conclusions": "Exposure to simulated microgravity and low-dose rate radiation decreases methylation potential of the heart. The hearts had mostly recovered from these two experimental conditions at late observation time points. Further research is needed with larger numbers of animals for a more robust statistical power to fully characterize the early and late effects of simulated microgravity combined with exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation on the heart.",
    "relationships": "The study suggests a relationship between exposure to simulated microgravity and low-dose rate radiation, and decreased methylation potential and oxidative stress in the heart. The combined exposure to both factors appears to have a greater effect than either insult alone in the short term. There is also a relationship between the treatments and a decrease in T-lymphocyte infiltration.",
    "insights": "The heart may be more susceptible to oxidative insults and changes in methylation potential following exposure to simulated microgravity and low-dose rate radiation. The effects appear to be temporary, with the heart showing signs of recovery over time. The study highlights the need for further research to fully understand the long-term effects of space travel on cardiovascular health.",

    "objective": "To characterize the effects of spaceflight on retinal vascular alterations and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) integrity, and to identify changes in protein expression profiles in mouse ocular tissue following spaceflight.",
    "methodology": "Ten-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were flown to the International Space Station (ISS) for 35 days. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured before and after the flight. Ocular tissues were collected for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and proteomics analysis. TUNEL assay was used to assess apoptosis. Expression of proteins related to BRB integrity (AQP-4, PECAM-1, ZO-1) was evaluated. Proteomics analysis was performed using LC/MS on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to identify significantly affected canonical pathways.",
    "results": "IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements in one eye. Apoptosis was significantly higher in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells of flight mice. Increased expression of AQP-4 and PECAM-1, and a tendency for decreased expression of ZO-1 were observed in flight mice. Proteomics analysis identified 485 significantly differentiated proteins, with alterations in pathways related to cell death, adhesion junction/tight junction signaling, calcium signaling, mitochondrial function, and metabolism.",
    "conclusions": "Spaceflight induces apoptosis in retinal vascular endothelial cells and photoreceptors, and alters the expression of proteins related to BRB integrity, suggesting a disruption of barrier function. Changes in protein expression profiles indicate that spaceflight induces changes in cellular organization, cell cycle, mitochondrial function, circadian clock, and oxidative stress in the retina. These findings suggest that astronauts may be at risk for retinal damage and late degeneration.",
    "relationships": "Spaceflight-induced changes in the retina are similar to those observed in diseases where the BRB is compromised, such as diabetes. The study suggests a link between spaceflight, BRB disruption, and potential ocular impairment. The results also highlight the limitations of using mice to study the effects of spaceflight on bodily function compared to rats, particularly regarding fluid shifts.",
    "insights": "The study provides evidence that spaceflight can lead to significant changes in the eye, including damage to the blood-retinal barrier and alterations in protein expression. These changes may contribute to the visual disturbances experienced by astronauts after long-duration spaceflight.

    "results": "Minimal gene expression and cytosine methylation alterations were observed after 4 months of readaptation in single treatment conditions (HLU or LDR). However, combined HLU+LDR exposure resulted in altered pathways involved in neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, neuropeptide regulation, and cellular signaling.",
    "conclusions": "Neurological readaptation following combined chronic LDR and HLU is a dynamic process involving pathways that regulate neuronal function and structure, potentially leading to late-onset neurological sequelae. Exposure to spaceflight-like conditions may lead to mild, long-term neurological consequences, while readaptation is an active process involving neuroplasticity and repair.",

Spaceflight may create unique epigenetic events and differential RNA splicing, leading to retinal damage and potentially accelerating retinal degeneration. Compensatory mechanisms are activated in response to oxidative stress, and the circadian rhythm of the retina is altered.",
    "relationships": "Spaceflight induces oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the retina, similar to the Earth-analog disease retinitis pigmentosa. Changes in chromatin architecture during spaceflight can influence the accessibility of genes and regulatory elements in the genome, potentially driving changes in gene expression and cellular behavior.",
    "insights": "Long duration space missions require evaluation of compensatory mechanisms and countermeasures to mitigate retinal damage caused by spaceflight. Supplementation with certain minerals and vitamins, especially vitamin A, may delay disease progression. Further research is needed to understand the mechanism of spaceflight-induced oxidative stress on retinal damage and to separate disease-causing changes in gene expression from compensatory changes.",

A significantly increased expression of AQP-4 was observed in the retina following a single dose exposure compared to controls. There was also a significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and a decrease in the expression of ZO-1 in the retina.",
    "conclusions": "Exposure to proton radiation of 0.5 Gy induced oxidative stress-associated apoptosis in the retina and ONH, and changes in BRB integrity in the retina. The study also revealed differences in BRB biomarker distribution between these two regions, suggesting that the cellular response in the retina and ONH may be differentially regulated in acute or hyperfractionated dose schedules.",

    "objective": "To determine whether growing wheat in outer space affects the weight and basic parameters of the grain, and whether this leads to increased asymmetry of the kernel and distortion of the starch composition.",
    "methodology": "Wheat kernels of the Super Dwarf cultivar were grown on the International Space Station (ISS) in the Lada growth chamber and compared to control wheat grown in a similar chamber under terrestrial conditions. Kernel parameters (weight, area, length, width, roundness, depth), starch granule characteristics, and aleurone layer cell dimensions were measured and compared. Hyperspectral imaging was used to analyze spectral profiles and calculate NDVI indices.",
    "results": "Wheat grown on the ISS had significantly smaller kernels by weight, area, length, and width. The length of type A starch granules in filled kernels from the ISS was significantly longer than in kernels from the ground experiment. The width of the aleurone layer cells in mature kernels from the ISS was significantly smaller. No significant differences in fluctuating asymmetry were found. Hyperspectral analysis showed similar spectral profiles between ISS and ground control kernels.",
    "conclusions": "Growing wheat in space resulted in smaller kernels and alterations in starch and aleurone layer composition. The phototropic responses of plants are likely the main factor preventing drastic gravitational responses in space. Further research is needed to optimize growth conditions and select cultivars better adapted to space environments.",
    "relationships": "The study explores the relationship between spaceflight conditions (primarily microgravity) and wheat kernel characteristics, including size, shape, starch composition, and aleurone layer structure. It also investigates the correlation between kernel asymmetry and various morphological parameters.",
    "insights": "The findings suggest that while wheat can be grown in space, the resulting kernels exhibit some differences compared to those grown on Earth. These differences may be related to stress responses, water availability, or tissue hypoxia during seed formation. Optimizing growth chamber conditions and selecting appropriate cultivars are crucial for improving the quality of space-grown wheat.",

    "methodology": "The study used a combination of genetic, molecular, and physiological approaches, including mutant screening, gene cloning, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, RNA-seq, yeast two-hybrid assays, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, western blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and live cell imaging.",
    "results": "The rice mutant *crw1* exhibits root coiling in hydroponic culture but normal gravitropic growth in soil. *crw1* is a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3-binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and amplified ethylene signaling. OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which regulates the transcription of genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation of ROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure, impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resulting in severely impaired gravitropism. Mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling restores gravitropism in soil-grown plants.",
    "conclusions": "The study identified the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots. Root cap mechanosensing limits excessive ethylene signaling, safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots. Gentle mechanical resistance enhances the degradation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylene signaling in *crw1*, leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The rescue of root gravitropism in *crw1* by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca2+ signaling in the root cap.",
    "relationships": "Ethylene signaling interacts with auxin signaling and mechanosensing to regulate root gravitropism. OsCRW1 interacts with OsEIL1 and OsEIL2, promoting their degradation. OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 act on OsERF82, which regulates ROS production. ROS accumulation disrupts auxin distribution by impairing OsPIN2 localization.",
    "insights": "Ethylene's effect on root gravitropic growth is tightly regulated. Root cap mechanosensing plays an unexpected role in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots. The OsCRW1-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS module is critical for connecting ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots.

Samples were prepared for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to assess structural changes and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine the cellular distribution and expression of mucin (Muc19), parotid secretory protein (PSP), demilune cell and parotid protein (DCPP), and the type II regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-RII). Quantitative analyses of immunogold labeled micrographs were performed to determine protein expression levels.",

    "methodology": "The study employed an improved method for visualizing and quantifying root surface pH using Fluorescein-5-(and-6)-Sulfonic Acid, Trisodium Salt (FS).  Mutant lines with altered auxin transport, perception, and response were analyzed.  Immunolocalization, pharmacological treatments, and genetic manipulations were used to assess the roles of AHA ATPases, auxin transporters (AUX1, PIN2), and components of the rapid auxin response pathway (AFB1, CNGC14). Root gravitropism and penetration through artificial obstacles were also tested.",
    "results": "The Arabidopsis root shows distinct acidic and alkaline root surface pH domains. The alkaline domain in the transition zone is not directly determined by AHA activation or localization but requires AUX1-mediated auxin influx. The components of the rapid auxin response pathway steer the transition zone root surface pH. The AUX1-AFB1-CNGC14 module facilitates root navigation.",
    "conclusions": "The alkaline surface pH domain originates from a constant rapid auxin response driven by the AUX1-AFB1-CNGC14 module. This response enables the roots to rapidly react to gravity vector changes and to adjust the root tip growth direction. The longitudinal surface pH zonation is not solely based on the activity and abundance of PM AHA H+ ATPases, but instead, the alkaline domain in the transition zone is driven by AUX1-mediated auxin influx and AFB1 signaling.",
    "relationships": "The alkaline domain at the transition zone depends on AUX1-mediated auxin influx. Without auxin influx, the root shows a linear acidification gradient from the root tip to the maturation zone. The rapid auxin response pathway, specifically AFB1 and CNGC14, steers the pH profile of the root during normal steady-state growth by controlling the alkaline domain in the transition zone. The TIR1 canonical signaling pathway contributes to the overall increase of root surface pH upon auxin treatment.",
    "insights": "The study reveals that the alkaline domain in the transition zone of Arabidopsis roots is a site of constant rapid auxin response, triggered by internal auxin fluxes mediated by AUX1 and PIN2 transporters. This dynamic response enables the root to quickly regulate its growth direction, particularly in the soil environment.",

    "relationships": "Piezo1 defines MuSC subtypes and coordinates the MuSC transition toward cells with less protrusions in homeostasis and regeneration. In muscular dystrophy, protrusion length is aberrantly regulated, Piezo1 levels are low, and the number of cells with few protrusions is reduced. Pharmacological reactivation of Piezo1 ameliorates the aberrant morphology of diseased MuSCs and boosts muscle regeneration in dystrophic mice.",
    "insights": "Quiescent MuSC populations represent a collection of morphologically heterogeneous states with different functional capabilities. Piezo1 is essential for maintaining MuSC states and regulating protrusion length and cell shape in both homeostatic and dystrophic muscles. Reactivation of Piezo1 in dystrophic muscles restores protrusion length, better regulates MuSC heterogeneity, and promotes proper function during repetitive injuries.",

    "methodology": "Mice were subjected to hindlimb suspension (HLS) to mimic microgravity and whole-body irradiation (IR) to simulate cosmic radiation. Telomere length was measured in muscle stem cells (MuSCs), myonuclei, and endothelial cells using CRYO MuQ-FISH. Expression of telomerase (TERT) and ALT-related genes (ATRX, DAXX) were assessed using qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Telomerase activity was measured by TRAP assay.",
    "results": "Combined HLS and IR resulted in telomere lengthening in MuSCs and myonuclei, but not in endothelial cells. Telomere lengthening was not reversed after a 2-week recovery period. Telomerase activity was low, suggesting an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism. Downregulation of ATRX and DAXX transcripts in HLS + IR muscles suggests engagement of ALT-related pathways.",

    "methodology": "Experiments were conducted on Populus trees, including wild-type and transgenic lines with altered ARK2 expression. Methods included time-lapse video analysis of gravibending, histological analysis of tension wood, immunolocalization of PIN3 auxin transporter and arabinogalactan proteins (FLAs), XET activity visualization, GUS reporter assays for auxin response, polar auxin transport measurements, RNA sequencing, and weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA).",
    "results": "Graviperception likely occurs in specialized cells within the woody stem containing starch-filled amyloplasts and expressing PIN3. Gravistimulation leads to PIN3 relocalization toward the ground, influencing auxin transport. GA stimulates fiber production and gravibending, with effects sensitive to ARK2 levels. Transcriptome analysis revealed a massive reprogramming of gene expression in opposite wood. Gene coexpression network analysis identified modules associated with wood phenotypes, GA response, and ARK2 binding.",
    "conclusions": "The study identifies key regulatory mechanisms in woody stem gravitropism, including graviperception cells, PIN3-mediated auxin transport, and interacting roles for auxin, GA, and ARK2. Lateral auxin transport is an early graviresponse, triggering differential xylem tissue development. GA stimulates fiber production, with effects modulated by ARK2. Opposite wood undergoes significant gene expression reprogramming during gravitropism.",
    "relationships": "Auxin transport is influenced by PIN3 localization in response to gravity. GA potentiates auxin responses and interacts with ARK2 to regulate fiber development. ARK2 influences the expression of genes involved in cell wall development and hormone-related functions.  FLA gene expression is differentially regulated by GA in different wood types and ARK2 genotypes.",
    "insights": "Woody stems perceive gravity directly via specialized cells.  Lateral auxin transport is a key early event in gravitropism.  GA and ARK2 play interacting roles in regulating wood formation.  Opposite wood is not merely a passive responder but undergoes active gene expression changes.

Typhimurium.",
    "methodology": "P. aeruginosa PAO1 was cultured in spaceflight and on the ground using a fluid-processing apparatus (FPA). RNA extraction, labeling, and Affymetrix GeneChip analysis were performed to analyze transcriptional responses. Proteins were identified using multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) analysis and tandem mass spectrometry.",
    "results": "Spaceflight conditions induced 52 genes and downregulated 115 genes in P. aeruginosa PAO1. Hfq, an RNA binding protein, was identified as a key regulator. Genes involved in anaerobic metabolism were upregulated, while those involved in purine and pyrimidine metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and ribosome synthesis were downregulated. Several virulence factors, including lectins LecA and LecB, chitinase, and rhamnolipid-encoding gene rhlA, were induced.",
    "conclusions": "Spaceflight conditions activated pathways in P. aeruginosa that are involved in the in vivo infection process. Hfq is a main transcriptional regulator in the spaceflight response of P. aeruginosa, representing the first transcriptional regulator commonly involved in the spaceflight responses of different bacterial species. The experimental setup and oxygen availability play a crucial role in the observed transcriptional differences.",
    "relationships": "The study compared gene expression profiles of P. aeruginosa with S. Typhimurium under spaceflight conditions, finding a significant overlap in downregulated genes. It also compared the spaceflight response of P. aeruginosa with its response to low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG), identifying similarities and differences in gene regulation.",

    "objective": "To fully sequence and analyze the DNA of plasmids pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3, and pChi7122-4 of APEC strain x7122, and to evaluate the contribution of these plasmids, as well as plasmid pChi7122-1, either individually or in combination, in bacterial interaction with a model human intestinal epithelial cell line, bile and acid resistance, biofilm formation, and growth in iron-restricted medium and in the presence of different carbon sources. Also, to determine the effect of different host strain backgrounds on plasmid-associated phenotypes.",
    "methodology": "The study involved sequencing and analyzing plasmids from APEC strain x7122.  In vitro experiments were conducted using APEC derivative strains and E. coli K-12 strains with various plasmid combinations.  These strains were tested for biofilm formation, bile and acid tolerance, interaction with 3-D cultures of intestinal epithelial cells, and growth in different media.  PCR was used to assess the presence of specific genes in various E. coli strains.  Bioinformatic analysis was used to predict protein structures and functions.",
    "results": "The sequences of plasmids pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3, and pChi7122-4 were determined. pChi7122-2 encodes an ABC iron transport system (eitABCD) and a putative type IV fimbriae. pChi7122-4 is a cryptic plasmid. pChi7122-2 contains a gene cluster predicted to encode sugar catabolic pathways, similar to those found in Salmonella.  Plasmids influenced biofilm formation, bile and acid tolerance, and interaction with intestinal epithelial cells, with the effects varying depending on the plasmid combination and host strain background.  pChi7122-1 and pChi7122-2 were involved in bile resistance, while pChi7122-3 was involved in acid tolerance.  Different O-LPS structures also affected biofilm formation.",
    "conclusions": "The study revealed new insights into the genetic and phenotypic mechanisms that ExPEC may use for their persistence and survival in stressful conditions.  The plasmids pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 contain genes that could be important in the fitness and persistence of APEC x7122. Large plasmids were involved in bile resistance and acid tolerance. Multiple factor-driven biofilms expressed at different temperatures could have distinct functions. The genotypic and phenotypic analysis of plasmid-derivative strains of an ExPEC model strain x7122 revealed new insights into the mechanisms of fitness of ExPEC and their diversity.",
    "relationships": "The study highlights the relationship between plasmids, bacterial fitness, and environmental conditions.

The study also reveals potential zoonotic risks associated with APEC strains.",
    "insights": "The presence of specific plasmids can significantly impact the fitness and survival of ExPEC strains.  The ability of ExPEC to form biofilms, resist bile and acid, and utilize different carbon sources is influenced by plasmid content and environmental factors.  The study suggests that understanding the mechanisms of plasmid-mediated fitness is crucial for developing strategies to prevent and treat ExPEC infections.

    "methodology": "The study used a 3-D intestinal model derived from INT-407 cells. NV was purified from stool specimens and used to infect the 3-D cultures. Viral RNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to detect viral proteins and histo-blood group antigens (HBGA). FUT2 genotyping assays were performed. The cultures were also exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to determine its effect.",
    "results": "No evidence of NV replication was found by real-time PCR of viral RNA or by immunocytochemical detection of viral structural and nonstructural proteins. The 3-D cultures also showed no detectable presence of histo-blood group antigens that participate in NV binding and host tropism. Exposure to lipopolysaccharide concentrations consistent with contaminated stool samples resulted in morphologic features similar to CPE.",
    "conclusions": "The 3-D INT-407 model does not support NV replication. The CPE-like morphologic changes observed after NV inoculation were most likely a result of LPS within the virus inocula and not due to NV replication. The lack of HBGA carbohydrates on the surface of the intestinal cells further highlights that this model is likely not a sufficient model system to study NV replication.",
    "relationships": "Norovirus (NoV) has been identified as the primary etiologic agent of acute epidemic viral gastroenteritis in industrialized countries. Human-to-human transmission of NoV occurs primarily through the fecal-oral route, with the small intestine being the initial site of viral replication. Persons who lack a functional FUT2 gene cannot generate ABH antigens in secretions and, thus, are termed nonsecretors.",
    "insights": "The study suggests that the previously reported successful NV infection in the 3-D INT-407 model may have been due to contamination of the virus stocks with LPS. The absence of HBGA expression in the 3-D model indicates that it is not a suitable system for studying NV replication. Future attempts to develop in vitro systems to study NoV replication may include cultures derived from human primary intestinal cells and tissue explants, utilization of Caco-2 cells grown in RWV, use of 3-D intestinal immunocompetent coculture models, or human intestinal organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells.",

    "results": "LSMMG resulted in similar growth kinetics across Enterobacteriaceae. Acid stress resistance was decreased in LSMMG for S. Typhimurium but increased for E. coli. Oxidative stress resistance was decreased by LSMMG for all tested genera. qPCR analysis showed that a molecular response to LSMMG resulting in gene expression changes is conserved across Enterobacteriaceae, but the direction of gene expression change can vary.

    "objective": "To investigate the impact of Candida albicans colonization on ethanol preference and related behaviors in mice, and to elucidate the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in these effects.",
    "methodology": "Mice were colonized with C. albicans and subjected to two-bottle choice experiments (ethanol vs. water, saccharin vs. water). Serum PGE2 levels were measured. Some mice were injected with PGE2 derivatives or EP1/EP2 receptor antagonists. Gene expression in brain regions (dorsal striatum, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens) was analyzed. Conditioned taste aversion (CTA), open field activity test (OFT), balance beam test, and loss of righting reflex (LORR) experiments were performed to assess behavioral effects.",
    "results": "C. albicans colonization reduced ethanol consumption and preference in mice. Colonized mice had elevated serum PGE2 levels. PGE2 injection reduced ethanol preference. EP1/EP2 receptor antagonism reversed the reduction in ethanol consumption. C. albicans colonization altered dopamine receptor expression in the dorsal striatum and accelerated ethanol-induced CTA. Colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced motor coordination impairment, which was reversed by EP receptor antagonism.",
    "conclusions": "C. albicans colonization influences ethanol preference and behavioral responses to ethanol in mice, mediated by PGE2 signaling and alterations in dopamine receptor expression. The gut fungal microbiome can impact host ethanol consumption and behavior.",
    "relationships": "C. albicans colonization elevates serum PGE2, which correlates with changes in EP and Drd receptor expression in the dorsal striatum. Altered dopamine receptor expression correlates with changes in ethanol consumption. C. albicans colonization and ethanol exposure synergistically affect motor coordination and sedation.",

    "methodology": "A microfluidic device with real-time imaging was used to expose C. elegans to four anthelmintic drugs (pyrantel, levamisole, tribendimidine, and methyridine) at equipotent concentrations (EC75). Worm behavior was quantified using parameters such as curls per second, types of paralyzation (crawling, curling, flailing), mode frequency, and number/duration of active/immobilization periods. A custom worm tracking software was used to analyze the movement.",
    "results": "Significant differences were observed in the manner with which worms paralyzed in different drug environments. Pyrantel and levamisole showed similar movement phenotypes with frequent curling. Methyridine induced a swimming-like motion. Tribendimidine resulted in shorter active periods and longer immobilization periods. Pyrantel was more effective than levamisole in immobilizing worms. Methyridine acts on a different subtype of nAChR receptors than the other three anthelmintics.",
    "conclusions": "The study highlights the need for assaying drug effects on small animal models with multiple parameters quantified at regular time points over an extended period to adequately capture the resistance and adaptability in chemical environments. The multi-parameter extraction method expands the repertoire of phenotypic characterization tools available in existing drug-based microfluidic devices.",
    "relationships": "Pyrantel and levamisole act on the same subtype of nAChR receptors (L-subtype). Tribendimidine affects C. elegans using a similar pathway as levamisole and hence belong to the same class of L-subtype nAChR agonists. Methyridine targets N-subtype nAChR receptors.",
    "insights": "The effectiveness of anthelmintic drugs can be differentiated by analyzing the patterns of worm adaptation, such as the frequency of body curls, mode transitions, and immobilization patterns. The number of active periods and time durations of immobilization could help compare the effectiveness of a single or a cocktail of multiple anthelmintics for single dose therapies where irreversible paralysis is desired.",

    "objective": "To examine the roles of individual 14-3-3 isoforms in root elongation and chloroplast development, controlled by the photosensory system, using T-DNA insertion mutants of 14-3-3 l and t.",
    "methodology": "Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutants (14-3-3 l and t) were grown under various light conditions (constant light, red light, blue light, dark) on MS media. Root lengths were measured, and chloroplast development was visualized using fluorescent and confocal microscopy. Nitrate reductase activity was factored out by growing plants on nitrate-free media. Quantitative analysis of red tonal levels in root images was performed.",
    "results": "14-3-3l-1 mutants exhibited shorter roots than wild-type under constant light, with root length influenced by light intensity. 14-3-3t mutants showed wild-type root length under constant light but shorter roots under red light. 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and CO mutants developed increased numbers of chloroplasts during early development. Blue light stimulated more root chloroplast development than red light. Decreased root length of 14-3-3l-1 was not due to altered nitrate reductase activity.",
    "conclusions": "14-3-3 proteins play novel roles in root growth and chloroplast development. 14-3-3 l is important for root growth, while 14-3-3 t affects root length under red light.

HsfA2 has specific roles in adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling, signal perception and transduction, and starch biosynthesis. Disabling HsfA2 altered the physiological state of the cells and impacted the mechanisms induced to adapt to spaceflight.",
    "conclusions": "The HSF network, particularly HSFA2, plays a non-thermal role in spaceflight adaptation. Proficient spaceflight adaptation requires a functional HSF network. HSFA2 is involved in cell wall and plasma membrane signaling, as well as starch biosynthesis. Disabling HsfA2 leads to ER stress and alters adaptation to spaceflight.",

    "objective": "To investigate the link between spaceflight-induced immune dysfunction and changes in metabolism in mice.",
    "methodology": "Female C57BL/6J mice were flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for ~13 days. Innate immune function (population distributions, oxidative burst capacity, phagocytosis), stress responses (adrenal catecholamine and corticosterone levels), metabolomics, and transcriptomics were assessed in the liver and spleen.",
    "results": "Spaceflight decreased major splenic leukocyte subset counts and lymphocyte subset counts. Splenic background ROS and oxidative burst increased, but phagocytosis decreased. Adrenal corticosterone levels tended to increase, while ACTH receptors decreased. Liver metabolite levels were altered, with changes in glutathione synthesis and osmolyte concentrations. Liver gene expression patterns related to viral infections, endocytosis, peroxisome formation, glycolysis, and lipid metabolism were also altered. Glycogen stores in the liver were reduced.",
    "conclusions": "Spaceflight causes transient changes in immune function that may be partially due to shifts in energy needs in space. The shifts in immune function may be related to shifts in energy needs in space, with a potential shift in priorities in phagocytic populations away from antigen processing toward lipid processing, potentially increasing risk for infection. The study also suggests spaceflight-induced alterations in the response to insulin that may correlate with insulin resistance.",
    "relationships": "Spaceflight-induced immune dysfunction is linked to systemic changes in metabolism. Corticosterone promotes fat breakdown, providing glycerol to the liver for gluconeogenesis. PPAR activity is altered in spaceflight, which can interfere with immune regulators and mediate macrophage responses.",

    "insights": "The developmental stage of the seedlings influences the transcriptional response to microgravity. The downregulation of stress-related genes in microgravity is in contrast to other spaceflight experiments that compare flight samples to ground controls, highlighting the importance of the onboard 1g control.

    "methodology": "RNA sequencing was performed on liver samples from mice in spaceflight and ground control groups. Different euthanasia methods, tissue and carcass preservation protocols, and library preparation methods (polyA selection vs. ribodepletion) were compared. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to identify enriched gene ontology terms.",
    "results": "Preservation method (immediate vs. carcass) was the primary driver of gene expression variance, eclipsing differences between flight and ground samples. Carcass-preserved samples exhibited less uniform transcript coverage than immediate-preserved samples. Ribodepletion mitigated the impact of preservation method on gene expression changes.

    "conclusions": "Apyrase inhibitors enhance the potency of fungicides against plant-pathogenic fungi, possibly by reducing ATP-driven efflux of fungicides from fungal cells and disrupting the ATP concentration gradient across the plasma membrane. The inhibitors may also disrupt apyrase activity in the Golgi, affecting glycosylation of efflux transporters. This enhancement could lead to more effective fungicide formulations.",
    "relationships": "Apyrases and ABC transporters are linked in fungi, similar to plants, in herbicide resistance and auxin transport. Disruption of apyrase activity can inhibit ABC transport activity, blocking the efflux of toxic compounds. Apyrase inhibitors can reduce the activity of ATP-driven efflux transportation of fungicides out of the hyphae of several pathogenic fungi.",
    "insights": "The study suggests that apyrase inhibitors could be a valuable addition to fungicide formulations, potentially reducing crop losses due to fungal pathogens. The findings highlight the conserved functional relationship between apyrases and efflux transporters in both plants and fungi, offering a potential target for improving pesticide efficacy.",

    "methodology": "The study used Arabidopsis knockout mutants (ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, and ann1-2/ann2-1) and an ANN1-overexpressing line (35S:ANN1).  Experiments included measurements of primary root length, hypocotyl length, growth rates, Lugol staining for starch detection in columella cells, starch quantification, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), chlorophyll autofluorescence detection, GC/MS analysis for soluble sugars, CFDA application for post-phloem transport detection, ROS detection using H2DCFDA, and aniline blue staining for callose accumulation.",
    "results": "ANN1 and ANN2 knockout mutants showed inhibited primary root growth, which was rescued by exogenous sucrose, glucose, or fructose, but not by mannitol or sorbitol. The mutants also exhibited root cap developmental defects, reduced starch levels in root tips, and enhanced expression of photosynthesis-related genes and chlorophyll accumulation in cotyledons.  Unexpectedly, the mutants had higher soluble sugar content in primary roots but impaired post-phloem transport in root tips, increased ROS levels, and callose accumulation.",
    "conclusions": "ANN1 and ANN2 play an important role in post-phloem sugar transport to the root tip, which indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons.  The impaired sugar transport in the mutants leads to sugar starvation in the root apex, triggering an up-regulation of photosynthesis.  The study expands the understanding of annexin function in plants by linking ANN1 and ANN2 to the regulation of primary root growth and development through their role in post-phloem sugar transport.",
    "relationships": "The study establishes a relationship between ANN1 and ANN2 function, post-phloem sugar transport, root tip sugar status, and photosynthetic rates in cotyledons. It also suggests a connection between ROS accumulation, callose deposition, and impaired sugar transport in the mutants.",

    "results": "Muscle mass and function were significantly impaired in reduced weight-bearing environments as early as 7 days of suspension. Muscular alterations correlated with the PWB level and did not reach a plateau during the 1-month exposure.

It also discusses the reliability of the model and its application in studying various physiological alterations. Studies involved exposing rats to different levels of partial weight-bearing (PWB20, PWB40, PWB70) and comparing them to fully loaded controls (PWB100). Measurements included body weight, food intake, muscle size (calf circumference, hindlimb muscle mass, myoﬁber cross-section area), muscle force (rear paw grip force, maximal torque during plantar or dorsi-ﬂexion), bone mineral density (BMD), and cardiovascular parameters (tail blood pressure, foot oximetry, heart rate).",
    "results": "The rat PWB model allows for the investigation of gravity as a continuum and mimics gravity shifts lower than 1g. Partial mechanical loading results in a dose-dependent muscular deconditioning in the hindlimbs, consistent with the physiological alterations observed during spaceflight and hypokinesia. Forelimb muscles also displayed atrophy during partial unloading. Skeletal impairments, including a dose-dependent decrease in tibial BMD, were observed. The use of a pelvic harness during normal loading did not impair indirect measures of blood flow nor did it modify blood pressure and heart rate over the course of the experiment. A moderate daily dose of resveratrol mitigates muscle deconditioning in a Martian gravity analog.",
    "conclusions": "The PWB model is a novel experimental method with extensive potential for the investigation of physiological alterations in response to both micro- and partial gravity.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using Tuxedo pipeline and DESeq2 software. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using DAVID, Cytoscape, and KEGG Mapper. Comparison of DEGs to the CERISE four-day spaceflight experiment was performed using GEO2R. Mass spectrometry was used for ceramide detection.",
    "results": "Exposure to simulated microgravity induced distinct gene expression patterns that were maintained even after 12 days of return to ground conditions. Downregulated genes were overrepresented in neuronal, epithelial tissues, and intestine, while upregulated genes were enriched in reproductive system-related tissues. Dorso-ventral axis formation was upregulated, and lysosome activity was downregulated during exposure. Sphingolipid signaling pathway was downregulated, leading to decreased ceramide levels. 134 common DEGs were identified between simulated microgravity and four-day CERISE spaceflight experiment.",

Enhanced Ca2+ uptake in FLT TA is directly related to the combined interaction of Acyp1 protein downregulation and Rps7 protein upregulation; while decreased Ca2+ uptake in FLT SOL is related to interactions of upregulation of several different pairs of genes, including Gpc4, Tle4, Rspo3, and Klhl31. TA muscles are more resilient to space conditions, and Acyp1 and Rps7 seem to be good candidates to counteract weight losses and poor Ca2+ uptake observed in SOL muscles.",
    "relationships": "Acyp1 inhibits Ca2+ transporters in SERCA-1 (fast-twitch muscle fibers). Rps7 is downregulated by nitrosative stress, which is related to impaired calcium reuptake. Trak2 enables myosin binding activity for muscle contraction. Tle4 acts as a corepressor regulating muscle cell differentiation.",
    "insights": "Spaceflight induces distinct molecular responses in different muscle types (TA vs. SOL).  Acyp1 and Rps7 may play a mechanistic role in the dysregulation of calcium induced by spaceflight.  Mitochondrial regulation and perturbation of actin and myosin structural regulation are molecular responses to spaceflight in muscle.",

    "results": "Spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in both rodents and humans. In mice, the liver was the most impacted organ, with inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling, leading to hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis.  Skeletal muscles also showed alterations in insulin and estrogen signaling.

Mechanical testing, spectroscopic (Raman), and imaging techniques (micro-computed tomography, synchrotron nano-X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy) were employed to examine the effects of extended unloading on the enthesis across a wide range of spatial scales.",
    "results": "Unloading led to compromised failure properties, including decreasing trends in strength and decreasing toughness of the attachment.

Carbonate levels in bone mineral were also decreased with unloading. Mineral was predominantly outside the collagen fibrils in regions of low mineralization.",
    "conclusions": "Unloading significantly increased the extent of failure of the enthesis, possibly due to structural changes across hierarchical scales. Trabecular bone volume in the humeral head was significantly decreased, leading to increased bending of the subchondral bone and subsequently increased failure area. Unloading led to decreases in crystal size and alignment, resulting in decreased energy absorption. Mineral carbonate content was decreased, increasing the stiffness of the crystals and thus the overall composite. Hierarchical changes at a variety of scales can affect the overall mechanical properties of the enthesis.",

    "methodology": "Two experiments were performed on female mice housed at room temperature (22°C) and near thermoneutral temperature (32°C). Experiment 1 involved leptin supplementation in wild-type mice. Experiment 2 evaluated BMAT response in wild-type and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice with and without leptin treatment. BMAT was measured after two weeks. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to measure body composition. Serum leptin, osteocalcin, and CTX-1 were measured using ELISA kits. Histomorphometry was performed on distal femora to assess bone formation and marrow adiposity. Gene expression analysis was conducted on brown adipose tissue (BAT), white adipose tissue (WAT), and tibia.",
    "results": "Leptin supplementation in wild-type mice decreased food intake, body fat, WAT mass, and BMAT. Bone area and mineral content were higher in leptin-supplemented mice.

    "results": "Polyethylene and JAXA bags supported worm growth, while FEP bags did not. Worms grown in CeMM had lower oxygen consumption rates than those grown in OP50. Optimal culture volume was 6-7 mL. Cage design 2 allowed for sufficient worm growth inside ECs. Short and long cold stowage upload scenarios produced viable cultures.",
    "conclusions": "The study successfully updated flight hardware and upload conditions for C. elegans experiments on the ISS.

Different micropillar geometries were tested to optimize locomotion and lifespan.  Culture conditions (washing, feeding frequency, and food concentration) were optimized.  Lifespan assays were conducted on wild-type and mutant C. elegans, comparing results with agar plate assays. RNAi was used to knockdown age-related genes. Healthspan measures (pharyngeal pumping, stimulated locomotion) were scored manually.  Fluorescence imaging was used to assess DAF-16 localization.",
    "results": "The optimized NemaLife Chip allowed for whole-life culture of C. elegans with efficient progeny removal and mimicked plate-like crawling behavior.  Specific micropillar geometry (Device III) resulted in locomotion gait similar to agar plates and consistent lifespan.  The NemaLife Chip eliminated animal loss due to desiccation and burrowing.  Mutant lifespan extensions and reductions were consistent with previous reports. RNAi knockdown of age-1 and daf-16 genes altered lifespan.  Age-dependent decline in pharyngeal pumping rate was observed.  Stimulated reversal speed declined with age.",

RNAi pharmacogenetic interventions and transcriptomics/network analysis were used to explore molecular events governing mtH2S donor-mediated health span.  Movement rates were measured using wMicroTracker, and neuromuscular strength was assessed using the NemaFlex device. Mitochondrial structure was assessed using GFP-tagged transgenic animals, and citrate synthase activity was measured as a marker of mitochondrial health.  Next-generation sequencing was performed on animals treated with mtH2S from L1 larvae or from day 0 of adulthood.  Transcription factor-binding site analysis was used to identify transcription factors predicted to regulate gene clusters.",
    "results": "mtH2S (AP39) significantly increased life span at lower doses compared to untargeted H2S. mtH2S also increased total animal movement rates and improved strength production. mtH2S sustained mitochondrial integrity and increased citrate synthase activity.  The positive effects of mtH2S on life span and health span were prevented by knockdown of H2S metabolism enzymes and FoxO/daf-16. Adult-onset mtH2S treatment increased health span but not life span, and rejuvenated aging transcriptomes by minimizing expression declines of mitochondria, cytoskeletal components, and peroxisome metabolism hub components. A GATA transcription factor regulatory circuit (elt-6/elt-3) was found to underpin the positive aging effects of mtH2S.",
    "conclusions": "mtH2S extends C. elegans health span, associating with improved mitochondrial integrity. Multiple elements of H2S metabolic pathways and FoxO transcription factors govern both life span and health span, while the Nrf2 antioxidant system is dispensable for mtH2S-induced health span extension. Adult mtH2S treatments increase health span and rejuvenate key features of the aging transcriptome, controlled by a GATA transcription factor circuit. mtH2S is a potential translational antiaging therapy.",

    "objective": "To characterize a novel bacterial species, Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T, isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), and to determine its phylogenetic placement within the genus Cohnella. The study also aimed to explore the functional traits predicted by the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T and its closely related clade.",
    "methodology": "The study employed a polyphasic taxonomic characterization, including phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes), and comparative genomic analyses. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T, Cohnella ginsengisoli, and Cohnella rhizosphaerae was performed. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using 16S rRNA and gyrB genes. Pangenomic analysis was used to identify shared and unique genes. Phenotypic characterization included growth temperature, pH, salt tolerance, oxidase and catalase activity, and carbon substrate utilization. Metagenomic reads from ISS surfaces were mapped to the genome of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T.",
    "results": "Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T was identified as a novel species, closely related to Cohnella rhizosphaerae and Cohnella ginsengisoli. ANI values between Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T and other Cohnella species were below 79.4%. Phylogenetic analyses placed strain F6_2S_P_1T within a clade containing C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli. The genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T contained genes for carbohydrate and amino acid transport and metabolism, transcription, cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis, and signal transduction mechanisms. The strain did not encode for N2 fixation. The C. ginsengisoli clade contained 322 gene clusters not found in any other Cohnella genome. Metagenomic reads from ISS surfaces showed minimal mapping to the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T.",
    "conclusions": "Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T is a novel species, named Cohnella hashimotonis, closely related to plant/rhizosphere-associated Cohnella species. It likely originated from plant commensals introduced to the ISS during plant growth experiments. C. hashimotonis can survive in the extreme conditions of the ISS and is a promising candidate for testing as a member of plant-growth-promoting consortia for future plant experiments in outer space.",
    "relationships": "Cohnella hashimotonis is closely related to Cohnella rhizosphaerae and Cohnella ginsengisoli, forming a distinct clade within the genus Cohnella. All members of this clade are associated with plant tissue or the rhizosphere environment, suggesting a mutualistic relationship with plant roots. The study suggests that C. hashimotonis may have been introduced to the ISS as a plant commensal.",
    "insights": "The study provides insights into the microbial diversity of the ISS and the potential for plant-associated bacteria to survive and adapt in extreme space environments. The identification of Cohnella hashimotonis as a novel species highlights the importance of characterizing microbial communities in closed habitats like the ISS. The functional traits predicted for C. hashimotonis and its closely related clade suggest potential applications in plant growth promotion and bioremediation in space.",

    "methodology": "Sixteen male rhesus monkeys were exposed to uniform total chest irradiation (10 Gy). CT scans were taken before and after irradiation (2, 4, 6, and 8 months). Bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) were calculated. Pathologic analysis of bone samples was performed. Statistical analysis included repeated measures ANOVA and paired t-tests.",
    "results": "Younger NHPs (<50 months) were more prone to pulmonary toxicity. Significant loss of Ct.Th in the in-field T9 occurred by 2 months post-IR, persisting to 8 months. No Ct.Th loss was observed in out-of-field vertebrae (L2, L4). Reduced BMD was observed by 4 months post-IR for T9 and by 6 months for L2 and L4. Histologically, regions with cortical thinning showed increased cortical porosity.",
    "conclusions": "Rapid cortical thinning and loss of BMD occurred post-RT. Younger age at IR was associated with greater sensitivity to radiation. Bone is a radiosensitive tissue, and patients with osteoporosis or pre-existing VCF may be at increased risk of fractures. Osteoclast inhibitory therapies may provide bone radioprotection.",
    "relationships": "Younger animals experienced more significant bone turnover and were more sensitive to radiation. The study highlights the dependence of radiation-induced bone changes on both dose and skeletal maturity. There was a correlation between cortical thinning observed in CT scans and increased cortical porosity observed histologically.",
    "insights": "High-dose radiation therapy can lead to rapid bone loss, particularly in younger individuals. Monitoring bone health and considering prophylactic interventions, such as osteoclast inhibitors, may be beneficial for patients undergoing radiation therapy. The dose threshold for bone damage may be very low.",

Hindlimb unloading was performed via tail suspension. Irradiation was performed using a clinical linear accelerator. Cartilage volume and thickness were analyzed using micro-computed tomography. Histology and molecular probing were used to assess cartilage composition and damage. Serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP) was measured. Proteomics and pathway analysis were performed on femoral head cartilage.",
    "results": "Significant radiation and load effects were identified on cartilage volume and thickness. Cartilage volume was reduced in all treatment groups compared to ground-sham. Cartilage thickness was significantly thinner at the tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact point after HLU and/or irradiation. Collagen area was reduced within the medial tibial plateau articular cartilage after HLU and/or irradiation. MMP-13 concentration was higher in HLU and ground-0.1 Gy relative to ground sham. Circulating serum COMP was significantly more in the irradiated groups compared to ground-sham.

    "methodology": "A transposon library was screened in the non-mucoid reference strain PAO1.  Mutants were analyzed for alginate production.  Genetic deletions and complementation assays were performed.  AlgW cleavage of MucA was assayed in vitro using synthetic peptides.  MucA-resin assays were used to test competition for MucB binding.",
    "results": "Overexpression of CupB5 induces mucoidy through the AlgU pathway. A peptide signal in CupB5 enhances OMP-activated cleavage of MucA by AlgW, even in the presence of MucB. CupB5 peptides stimulate OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA and partially relieve MucB inhibition in vitro.  MucB overproduction decreases alginate production in CupB5 overexpressing strains.",
    "conclusions": "CupB5, a protein normally secreted through the outer membrane by a chaperone-usher system, activates alginate production. Excess periplasmic CupB5 stimulates proteolytic cleavage of MucA by AlgW. The AlgU system integrates multiple signals, each reporting on potential dysfunction in outer-membrane assembly, structure, and/or secretion.",

    "insights": "CupB5 allows AlgW to compete more efficiently with MucB for MucA binding and cleavage. Simultaneous expression of CupB5 and MucE results in higher levels of alginate, indicating that these signals activate the alginate pathway through synergistic mechanisms. Stresses that compromise the transport to and outer-membrane assembly of OMPs and LPS, or that slow usher-mediated CupB5 secretion, would all lead to the periplasmic accumulation of these molecules and activation of the AlgU pathway.",

    "results": "Significant site-specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurred in the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. Spaceflight is associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. Mice housed in the NASA ISS Rodent Habitat during 1g ground controls maintained or gained bone relative to mice housed in standard vivarium cages.",
    "conclusions": "Mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity in female mice approaching skeletal maturity. Early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification is a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity.",
    "relationships": "Bone loss in the weight-bearing femoral head and distal epiphysis cancellous bone regions depends on housing type and spaceflight in microgravity. Long bone cortical tissues undergo degenerative changes in space. Load-bearing vertebrae do not show μCT parameter changes related to age, housing, or spaceflight in microgravity. Decreased mechanical loading during spaceflight in microgravity only causes significant bone loss in weight-bearing skeletal sites. Secondary endochondral ossification is accelerated during spaceflight in microgravity.",
    "insights": "Spaceflight-induced bone loss is localized to direct weight-bearing skeletal locations in the femoral head and distal epiphyses. The absence of significant bone loss in the L2 lumbar vertebra after 37 days of spaceflight is consistent with previous scans. Increased activity and microgravity have opposite effects on bone health parameters only at specific locations within weight-bearing bone and no significant effects in bones primarily loaded by muscle tension, as long as the habitat used, such as RH, is permissive of physical activity in space. Mechanical unloading due to weightlessness in microgravity, not radiation or other systemic factors, is the primary effector of spaceflight-related bone loss in LEO.",

    "results": "CRISP identified a biologically relevant set of genes uniquely predictive of a high lipid density response in space-flown mice. Mup11 gene was found in the top genes most predictive of lipid density in all models. Gene set enrichment and pathway analyses revealed that the dysfunctional regulation of the genes identified by CRISP is implicated in the spectrum of diseases caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",
    "conclusions": "The CRISP platform identified a set of genes predictive of high and low lipid density, significantly associated with gene sets and genetic pathways consistent with NAFLD or similar liver dysfunction. The use of data augmentation and environment invariance modeling approach is crucial for identifying robust correlations. The identified genes constitute potential biomarkers of NAFLD for targeted monitoring or therapeutics development.",
    "relationships": "Identified genes (Apoc1, Apoc3, Cyp2e1, Fasn, Scd1, Star, Apoe) are linked to lipid metabolism and NAFLD. Overexpression of Apoc1 and Apoc3 may lead to hyperlipidemia and NAFLD-like features. Cyp2e1 is implicated in the development of NASH. Fasn inhibition reduces triglyceride content and markers of fibrosis and inflammation. Scd1 causes excessive lipid accumulation and promotes progression of NAFLD. Star overexpression reduces hepatic lipid accumulation.",
    "insights": "Spaceflight induces significant changes in gene expression profiles related to lipid metabolism in the liver, even after short-term exposure. Machine learning methods, particularly those employing causal inference and data augmentation, can effectively identify key genes and pathways involved in spaceflight-induced liver dysfunction. The identified genes represent potential therapeutic targets for mitigating the adverse effects of spaceflight on liver health.",

    "methodology": "20-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to 14 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU) to simulate microgravity. Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured to assess arterial stiffness. Aortic tissue samples were analyzed for smooth muscle actin, myosin, collagen, elastin, GPER, PPARγ, oxidative stress markers (8-OHdG, p47phox), and inflammatory markers (COX-2, eNOS, CD68). A subset of HLU females were treated with the GPER agonist G1. Body composition was assessed using EchoMRI. Statistical analyses included ANOVA and DCS analysis.",
    "results": "HLU increased aortic PWV in females but not males. HLU females showed lower aortic GPER and PPARγ, increased oxidative stress markers, and diastolic dysfunction compared to controls. G1 treatment prevented the increase in PWV and 8-OHdG in HLU females. Male rats exposed to HLU had lower heart weight compared to the male control group. Multivariate data analysis revealed sex differences in relationships between oxidative stress markers, ECM characteristics, and arterial stiffness.",
    "conclusions": "Female Sprague Dawley rats exhibit greater arterial stiffness in response to simulated microgravity compared to males. This is associated with lower aortic GPER and PPARγ, and increased oxidative stress. GPER activation reverses HLU-induced arterial stiffening in females, suggesting a protective role. The SD female rat is a suitable model to study mechanisms underlying the development of arterial stiffness in females in response to simulated microgravity.",

    "conclusions": "Host-gut microbiome interactions during spaceflight are likely to underlie widespread changes to host physiology which could pose a risk to health. Spaceflight-associated changes in bacteria linked to bile and fatty acid metabolism were identified. The microbiome changes coincided with substantial changes to gene expression at the host-gut microbiome interface which are critical to barrier function, microbe interactions and bile acid transport in the intestine. These interactions suggest disruption of the signals, metabolites, and immune factors exchanged across the gut-liver axis which are likely to drive glucose and lipid dysregulation.",
    "relationships": "Spaceflight-associated pathologies, notably disrupted glucose metabolism characterized by insulin resistance and lipid metabolism dysregulation, pose significant risks to astronaut health. Gut microbiota play an essential role in mediating healthy human metabolic function on Earth. Changes in the gut microbiome can influence lipid and bile acid homeostasis, and the immune system of the murine host.",
    "insights": "Spaceflight induces changes in gut microbiota composition and function, leading to alterations in host metabolism and immune function. These changes may contribute to spaceflight-associated health risks, such as insulin resistance, lipid dysregulation, and immune suppression. The gut-liver axis is significantly disrupted during spaceflight, potentially driving glucose and lipid dysregulation.",

    "results": "Postflight snails exhibited enhanced negative gravitaxis response (faster re-orientation). Statoreceptor responses to tilt were independent of motion direction, with increased sensitivity to acceleration. mRNA expression of HPep, linked to ciliary beating, increased in statoreceptors. FMRFamide expression showed no significant difference.",

The life stage of invertebrate models appears to impact the degree by which they recapitulate the responses of mammalian tissues to spaceflight. Spaceflight elicited both shared and discrete responses in representative slow and fast twitch muscle types (soleus and EDL respectively).
